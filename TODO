  In bibtex import, mathematical formulas are exported without the enclosing dollars for
  entries coming before field AUTHORS. If field AUTHORS is the first in a reference item
  there is no problem.

  bibacc2 <- system.file("/bib/latin1accents_utf8a.bib", package = "rbibutils")
  be0a <- readBib(bibacc2)
  ## Error in .bibentry_check_bibentry1(rval) : 
  ##   A bibentry of bibtype ‘Article’ has to specify the field: author
  ## Warning message:
  ## In readBibentry(outfile) : key 'test1'
  ##       A bibentry of bibtype ‘Article’ has to specify the field: author
