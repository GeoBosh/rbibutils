TI  - Impact of Balloon Guide Catheter Use on Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes in the 
      STRATIS Stroke Thrombectomy Registry.
PG  - 697-704

AB  - Background and Purpose- Mechanical thrombectomy has been shown to improve clinical 
      outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, the impact of balloon 
      guide catheter (BGC) use is not well established. Methods- STRATIS (Systematic 
      Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic 
      Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter study of patients with large vessel occlusion 
      treated with the Solitaire stent retriever as first-line therapy. In this study, an 
      independent core laboratory, blinded to the clinical outcomes, reviewed all 
      procedures and angiographic data to classify procedural technique, target clot 
      location, recanalization after each pass, and determine the number of stent 
      retriever passes. The primary clinical end point was functional independence 
      (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) at 3 months as determined on-site, and the angiographic 
      end point was first-pass effect (FPE) success rate from a single device attempt 
      (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, ≥2c) as determined by a core 
      laboratory. Achieving modified FPE (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, 
      ≥2b) was also assessed. Comparisons of clinical outcomes were made between groups 
      and adjusted for baseline and procedural characteristics. All participating centers 
      received institutional review board approval from their respective institutions. 
      Results- Adjunctive technique groups included BGC (n=445), distal access catheter 
      (n=238), and conventional guide catheter (n=62). The BGC group had a higher rate of 
      FPE following first pass (212/443 [48%]) versus conventional guide catheter (16/62 
      [26%]; P=0.001) and distal access catheter (83/235 [35%]; P=0.002). Similarly, the 
      BGC group had a higher rate of modified FPE (294/443 [66%]) versus conventional 
      guide catheter (26/62 [42%]; P<0.001) and distal access catheter (129/234 [55%]; 
      P=0.003). The BGC group achieved the highest rate of functional independence 
      (253/415 [61%]) versus conventional guide catheter (23/55 [42%]; P=0.007) and distal 
      access catheter (113/218 [52%]; P=0.027). Final revascularization and mortality 
      rates did not differ across the groups. Conclusions- BGC use was an independent 
      predictor of FPE, modified FPE, and functional independence, suggesting that its 
      routine use may improve the rates of early revascularization success and good 
      clinical outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov

TI  - Impact of balloon guide catheter on technical and clinical outcomes: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 335-339
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow arrest with balloon guide catheters (BGCs) is becoming 
      increasingly recognized as critical to optimizing patient outcomes for mechanical 
      thrombectomy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature 
      for studies that compared angiographic and clinical outcomes for patients who 
      underwent mechanical thrombectomy with and without BGCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      April 2017 a literature search on BGC and mechanical thrombectomy for stroke was 
      performed. All studies included patients treated with and without BGCs using modern 
      techniques (ie, stent retrievers). Using random effects meta-analysis, we evaluated 
      the following outcomes: first-pass recanalization, Thrombolysis In Cerebral 
      Infarction (TICI) 3 recanalization, TICI 2b/3 recanalization, favorable outcome 
      (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2), mortality, and mean number of passes and 
      procedure time. RESULTS: Five non-randomized studies of 2022 patients were included 
      (1083 BGC group and 939 non-BGC group). Compared with the non-BGC group, patients 
      treated with BGCs had higher odds of first-pass recanalization (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.65 
      to 2.55), TICI 3 (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.17), TICI 2b/3 (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 
      1.97), and mRS 0-2 (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.22). BGC-treated patients also had 
      lower odds of mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.73) compared with non-BGC 
      patients. The mean number of passes was significantly lower for BGC-treated patients 
      (weighted mean difference -0.34, 95% CI-0.47 to -0.22). Mean procedure time was also 
      significantly shorter for BGC-treated patients (weighted mean difference -7.7 min, 
      95% CI-9.0to -6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Non-randomized studies suggest that BGC use during 
      mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke is associated with superior 
      clinical and angiographic outcomes. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm 
      the results of this study.

      Mechanical Thrombectomy.
PG  - 169-76
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2015150575 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy with the use of a 
      stent retriever in acute ischemic stroke, performed by using a balloon guide 
      catheter or non-balloon guide catheter. Materials and Methods In accordance with the 
      institutional review board approval obtained at the two participating institutions, 
      retrospective analysis was performed in 183 consecutive patients treated between 
      2013 and 2014 for occlusions in the middle cerebral artery or carotid terminus by 
      using a stent retriever with a balloon guide catheter (n = 102) at one center and a 
      non-balloon guide catheter (n = 81) at the other center. Data on procedure duration, 
      number of passes, angiographic findings, type of stent retriever used, and expertise 
      of the operators were collected. Successful recanalization was defined as grade 3 or 
      2b modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia recanalization accomplished in up to 
      three passes. Univariate and multivariate subgroup analyses were conducted to 
      control for the confounding variables of prior thrombolysis, location of occlusion, 
      and operator expertise. Results Successful recanalization with the balloon guide 
      catheter was achieved in 89.2% of thrombectomies (91 of 102) versus 67.9% (55 of 81) 
      achieved with the non-balloon guide catheter (P = .0004). The one-pass thrombectomy 
      rate with the balloon guide catheter was significantly higher than for that with the 
      non-balloon guide catheter (63.7% [65 of 102] vs 35.8% [29 of 81], respectively; P = 
      .001). The procedure duration was significantly shorter by using the balloon guide 
      catheter than the non-balloon guide catheter (median, 20.5 minutes vs 41.0 minutes, 
      respectively; P < .0001). Conclusion The effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy 
      with stent retrievers in acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation in terms 
      of angiographic results and procedure duration was improved when performed in 
      combination with the balloon guide catheter. (©) RSNA, 2016.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Solitaire stent retriever registry showed improved reperfusion, 
      faster procedure times, and better outcome in acute stroke patients with large 
      vessel occlusion treated with a balloon guide catheter (BGC) and Solitaire stent 
      retriever compared with a conventional guide catheter. The goal of this study was to 
      evaluate whether use of a BGC with the Trevo stent retriever improves outcomes 
      compared with a conventional guide catheter. METHODS: The TRACK registry recruited 
      23 sites to submit demographic, clinical, and site adjudicated angiographic and 
      outcome data on consecutive patients treated with the Trevo stent retriever. BGC use 
      was at the discretion of the physician. RESULTS: 536 anterior circulation patients 
      (of whom 279 (52.1%) had BGC placement) were included in this analysis. Baseline 
      characteristics were notable for younger patients in the BGC group (65.4±15.3 vs 
      68.1±13.6, P=0.03) and lower rate of hypertension (72% vs 79%, P=0.06). Mean time 
      from symptom onset to groin puncture was longer in the BGC group (357 vs 319 min, 
      P=0.06).Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3 scores were higher in the BGC 
      cohort (84% vs 75.5%, P=0.01). There was no difference in reperfusion time, first 
      pass effect, number of passes, or rescue therapy. Good clinical outcome at 3 months 
      was superior in patients with BGC (57% vs 40%; P=0.0004) with a lower mortality rate 
      (13% vs 23%, P=0.008). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BGC use was an 
      independent predictor of good clinical outcome (OR 2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1, P=0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In acute stroke patients presenting with anterior circulation large 
      vessel occlusion, use of a BGC with the Trevo stent retriever resulted in improved 
      reperfusion, improved clinical outcome, and lower mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVEThe role of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) has not been evaluated in 
      contact aspiration thrombectomy (CAT) for acute stroke. Here, the authors aimed to 
      test whether the BGC was associated with recanalization success and good functional 
      outcome in CAT.METHODSAll patients who had undergone CAT as the first-line treatment 
      for anterior circulation intracranial large vessel occlusion were retrospectively 
      identified from prospectively maintained registries for six stroke centers. The 
      patients were dichotomized into BGC utilization and nonutilization groups. Clinical 
      findings, procedural details, and recanalization success rates were compared between 
      the two groups. Whether the BGC was associated with recanalization success and 
      functional outcome was assessed.RESULTSA total of 429 patients (mean age 68.4 ± 11.4 
      years; M/F ratio 215:214) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A BGC was used in 45.2% 
      of patients. The overall recanalization and good outcome rates were 80.2% and 52.0%, 
      respectively. Compared to the non-BGC group, the BGC group had a significantly 
      reduced number of CAT passes (2.6 ± 1.6 vs 3.4 ± 1.5), shorter 
      puncture-to-recanalization time (56 ± 27 vs 64 ± 35 minutes), lower need for the 
      additional use of thrombolytics (1.0% vs 8.1%), and less embolization to a distal or 
      different site (0.5% vs 3.4%). The BGC group showed significantly higher final 
      (89.2% vs 72.8%) and first-pass (24.2% vs 8.1%) recanalization success rates. After 
      adjustment for potentially associated factors, BGC utilization remained 
      independently associated with recanalization (OR 4.171, 95% CI 1.523-11.420) and 
      good functional outcome (OR 2.103, 95% CI 1.225-3.612).CONCLUSIONSBGC utilization 
      significantly increased the final and first-pass recanalization rates and remained 
      independently associated with recanalization success and good functional outcome.

TI  - Balloon Guide Catheter Is Beneficial in Endovascular Treatment Regardless of 
      Mechanical Recanalization Modality.

AB  - Background and Purpose- Based on its mechanism, the use of balloon guide catheters 
      (BGCs) may be beneficial during endovascular treatment, regardless of the type of 
      mechanical recanalization modality used-stent retriever thrombectomy or 
      thrombaspiration. We evaluated whether the use of BGCs can be beneficial regardless 
      of the first-line mechanical endovascular modality used. Methods- We retrospectively 
      reviewed consecutive acute stroke patients who underwent stent retriever 
      thrombectomy or thrombaspiration from the prospectively maintained registries of 17 
      stroke centers nationwide. Patients were assigned to the BGC or non-BGC group based 
      on the use of BGCs during procedures. Endovascular and clinical outcomes were 
      compared between the BGC and non-BGC groups. To adjust the influence of the type of 
      first-line endovascular modality on successful recanalization and favorable outcome, 
      multivariable analyses were also performed. Results- This study included a total of 
      955 patients. Stent retriever thrombectomy was used as the first-line modality in 
      526 patients (55.1%) and thrombaspiration in 429 (44.9%). BGC was used in 516 
      patients (54.0%; 61.2% of stent retriever thrombectomy patients; 45.2% of 
      thrombaspiration patients). The successful recanalization rate was significantly 
      higher in the BGC group compared with the non-BGC group (86.8% versus 74.7%, 
      respectively; P<0.001). Furthermore, the first-pass recanalization rate was more 
      frequent (37.0% versus 14.1%; P<0.001), and the number of device passes was fewer in 
      the BGC group (2.5±1.9 versus 3.3±2.1; P<0.001). The procedural time was also 
      shorter in the BGC group (54.3±27.4 versus 67.6±38.2; P<0.001). The use of BGC was 
      an independent factor for successful recanalization (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 
      1.54-3.10; P<0.001) irrespective of the type of first-line endovascular modality 
      used. The use of BGC was also an independent factor for a favorable outcome (odds 
      ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.92; P=0.038) irrespective of the type of first-line 
      endovascular modality used. Conclusions- Regardless of the first-line mechanical 
      endovascular modality used, the use of BGC in endovascular treatment was beneficial 
      in terms of both recanalization success and functional outcome.

TI  - Optimizing fast first pass complete reperfusion in acute ischemic stroke - the 
      BADDASS approach (BAlloon guiDe with large bore Distal Access catheter with dual 
      aspiration with Stent-retriever as Standard approach).
PG  - 955-963
LID - 10.1080/17434440.2019.1684263 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Endovascular therapy is the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke 
      due to large vessel occlusions. The ultimate goal is to achieve fast first pass 
      complete reperfusion, since delayed and/or incomplete reperfusion increases 
      complication rates and costs and deteriorates patient outcome. Achieving optimal 
      results can sometimes be challenging, particularly in patients with tortuous 
      vessels. Several techniques have been described lately to optimize recanalization, 
      including first line aspiration and various stent-retriever assisted techniques. In 
      our experience, mechanical thrombectomy with a BAlloon guide catheter, large bore 
      Distal access catheter, Dual Aspiration and Stent-retriever as Standard approach 
      (BADDASS) is the most efficient technique to succeed, since it combines the 
      advantages of stent-retrievers and distal aspiration.Areas covered: The purpose of 
      this review is to enable neurointerventionalists to achieve fast first pass complete 
      reperfusion by outlining the BADDASS approach step-by-step and sharing additional 
      tips for navigating through challenging internal carotid artery segments.Expert 
      opinion: In our experience, the BADDASS approach is the safest and most effective 
      way to achieve fast first pass complete reperfusion.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare outcomes after endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic 
      stroke with and without the use of a balloon guide catheter (BGC) in clinical 
      practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial 
      of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN) 
      Registry were used, in which all patients who underwent EVT for anterior-circulation 
      stroke in The Netherlands between 2014 and 2016 were enrolled. Primary outcome was 
      modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included 
      reperfusion grade (extended Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] score) and 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 24-48 hours after 
      intervention. The association between the use of a BGC and outcomes was estimated 
      with logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, prestroke mRS score, NIHSS score, 
      collateral grade, and time from onset to EVT. RESULTS: A total of 887 patients were 
      included. Thrombectomy was performed with the use of a BGC in 528 patients (60%) and 
      without in 359 patients (40%). There was no significant association between use of a 
      BGC and a shift on the mRS toward better outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.17; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.52). Use of a BGC was associated with higher 
      eTICI score (adjusted common OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.70) and improvement of ≥ 4 
      points on the NIHSS (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04-1.88). CONCLUSIONS: In clinical 
      practice, use of a BGC was associated with higher reperfusion grade and early 
      improvement of neurologic deficits, but had no positive effect on long-term 
      functional outcome.

TI  - Endovascular Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment with FlowGate Balloon Guide Catheter: A 
      Single-Center Observational Study of FlowGate Balloon Guide Catheter Use.
PG  - 327-333
LID - 10.1159/000488601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke with 
      mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care after recent clinical 
      trials. However, the degree of recanalization with stent retrievers remains very 
      important in overall outcomes. We sought to review the utility of a new balloon 
      guide catheter (BGC) in improving the degree of recanalization in conjunction with 
      mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS: The medical records of a prospectively collected 
      endovascular ischemic stroke database were reviewed. All consecutive strokes when a 
      FlowGate BGC was used with a thrombectomy stent retriever were identified. Use of a 
      FlowGate BGC, number of passes, final Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 
      score, trackability, and use of adjunct devices were all collected and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Use of a FlowGate BGC resulted in 64% (33/52) first-pass effect (FPE) of 
      TICI 2b/3, and specifically 46% (24/52) TICI 3 FPE (true FPE). A total of 52/62 
      (84%) of thrombectomy cases were treated with BGCs. In the remaining 10, the BGC was 
      not inflated or used due to the clot not being visualized or the lesions being 
      distal and BGC use thus not deemed appropriate. Adjunct use of an aspiration 
      catheter was seen in 12% (6/52) of cases. The overall success with FlowGate BGCs 
      with one or more passes of TICI 2b/3 was 94% (49/52). Trackability was achieved in 
      92% (57/62) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the FlowGate BGC as an adjunct to 
      mechanical thrombectomy was associated with good FPE and an overall recanalization 
      of TICI 2b/3 of 94%.

TI  - Balloon-Guide Catheters Are Needed for Effective Flow Reversal during Mechanical 
      Thrombectomy.
PG  - 2077-2081
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A5829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood flow management in the carotid artery during 
      mechanical thrombectomy is crucial for safety and effectiveness. There is an ongoing 
      discussion about whether balloon-guide catheters or large-bore sheaths are needed 
      for effective flow management. We compared general flow characteristics of proximal 
      aspiration through a large-bore sheath and a balloon-guide catheter in a porcine in 
      vivo model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated blood flow in a porcine common 
      carotid artery with and without aspiration (VacLok syringe and Penumbra pump, Pump 
      MAX) through an 8F-long sheath and an 8F balloon-guide catheter. Blood hemodynamics 
      were assessed via continuous duplex sonography. RESULTS: Average vessel diameter and 
      baseline blood flow were 4.4 ± 0.2 mm and 244 ± 20 mL/min, respectively. For the 8F 
      sheath, pump aspiration resulted in a significant flow reduction (225 ± 25 mL/min, P 
      < .001), but with a persisting antegrade stream. Manual aspiration resulted in 
      collapse of the vessel in 2 of 7 measurements and oscillatory flow with antegrade 
      systolic and retrograde diastolic components in the remaining 5 measurements. Net 
      flow was antegrade (52 ± 44 mL/min) in 3 and retrograde (-95 ± 52 mL/min) in the 
      remaining 2 measurements. For balloon-guide catheters, balloon inflation always 
      resulted in flow arrest. Additional pump or manual aspiration resulted in 
      significant flow reversal of -1100 ± 230 and -468 ± 46 mL/min, respectively (both, P 
      < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Only balloon-guide catheters allow reliable blood flow arrest 
      and flow reversal in combination with aspiration via syringes or high-flow pump 
      systems. Aspiration through an 8F sheath results in either collapse of the vessel or 
      oscillatory flow, which can result in a net antegrade or retrograde stream.

TI  - Predictors of Balloon Guide Catheter Assistance Success in Stent-retrieval 
      Thrombectomy for an Anterior Circulation Acute Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - e5350
LID - 10.7759/cureus.5350 [doi]
LID - e5350
AB  - Introduction Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard treatment for large 
      vessel occlusion (LVO) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in well-selected patients. 
      Although many devices and strategies exist, the use of a balloon-tip guide catheter 
      (BGC) with stent-retriever (SR) may hold several advantages. We aim to assess the 
      efficacy and identify predictors of technical success of this unique approach. 
      Methods From our prospectively maintained database, we identified consecutive cases 
      in which a BGC was used for stent-retriever thrombectomy in anterior circulation 
      LVO between 2015 and 2016. Baseline and procedural characteristics were captured and 
      analyzed. Predictors of technical and clinical outcomes were identified by 
      multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Ninety-three patients with 
      AIS-LVO were treated with BGC-assisted mechanical thrombectomy. The mean age was 71 
      years old (SD 14), with 49.5% male (n=46). Pre-operative IV-tPA was administered in 
      55.9% (n=52) of cases. The most common location of occlusive thrombus was M1 (64.5%, 
      n=60). Successful recanalization (mTICI=2b-3) was achieved in 86.0% (n=80) of cases 
      while complete revascularization (mTICI-3) was achieved in 56.5% (n=52). There was a 
      first-pass success rate of 52.7% (n=49). At discharge, 38.7% of the patients were 
      functionally independent (mRS≤2). Multivariate analysis revealed that the middle 
      cerebral artery location was strongly predictive of first-pass success, resulting 
      in mTICI =2b revascularization (OR 7.10, p=0.018). Additionally, female gender (OR 
      2.85, p=0.042) and decreasing mTICI were associated with a poor clinical outcome 
      (mRS≥4; OR 1.76, p=0.008). Conclusions BGC assistance in stent retrieval 
      thrombectomy is safe and effective for AIS due to anterior circulation LVO. Further 
      investigation is required to elucidate the optimal treatment strategy based on 
      patient and disease characteristics.

TI  - 8-F balloon guide catheter for embolization of anterior circulation aneurysms: an 
      institutional experience in 152 patients.
PG  - 435-441
LID - 10.18999/nagjms.79.4.435 [doi]
AB  - The use of 8-F balloon guide catheter (BGC) for proximal flow control was previously 
      shown to prevent distal embolic complications during mechanical clot retrieval in 
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. In this retrospective study, the utility of 8-F 
      BGCs for proximal flow control during endovascular coiling of anterior circulation 
      aneurysms was investigated. Patients who underwent endovascular coiling for anterior 
      circulation aneurysms between August 2013 and December 2016 were retrospectively 
      analyzed. Among a total of 152 patients included in this series, 64 patients 
      presented with aneurysmal rupture, whereas the aneurysms were detected incidentally 
      or due to mass effects in the remaining patients. 8-F BGCs were successfully 
      navigated in all patients. The balloon was inflated during navigation in 19 
      patients. Inflation of the catheter balloon during coil embolization was required in 
      34 patients; this was performed as an emergency maneuver in six of these patients. 
      Thromboembolic complications occurred in one patient. 8-F BGC can be effectively 
      used for proximal flow control during endovascular treatment of anterior circulation 
      aneurysms. The other advantages included improved navigation of tortuous arterial 
      anatomy, coil stabilization during aneurysmal coiling, and freedom to utilize 
      aneurysmal neck-remodeling balloons for additional adjunctive techniques or to 
      deploy rescue stents. This novel approach might be safely and effectively used in 
      patients undergoing endovascular treatment for anterior circulation aneurysms.

TI  - Role of Balloon Guide Catheter in Modern Endovascular Thrombectomy.
PG  - 14-25
LID - 10.3340/jkns.2019.0114 [doi]
AB  - Proximal flow control achieved with a balloon guide catheter (BGC) during 
      endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke is reviewed in this article. In 
      clinical practice, BGCs offer a multi-faceted approach for clot retrieval by 
      creating proximal flow arrest, reducing embolic burden, and shortening procedure 
      time. Evaluation of frontline thrombectomy procedures with BGCs revealed advantages 
      of combined use over the conventional guide catheter (CGC), notably in the 
      significant reduction of distal emboli to both the affected and previously 
      unaffected territories. Recently, new measures of early and complete reperfusion at 
      first thrombectomy pass have been identified as independent predictors of improved 
      outcomes, which were consistently demonstrated with use of BGC as a safe and 
      effective option to minimize number of passes during intervention. Prior randomized 
      controlled trials reported the positive correlation between BGC-treated patients and 
      a lower risk of mortality as well as shortened procedure time. While BGC use is more 
      common in stent retriever-mediated mechanical thrombectomy, preliminary data has 
      shown the potential benefit of device application during contact aspiration 
      thrombectomy to achieve successful recanalization. However, the question of which 
      major endovascular strategy reigns superior as a frontline remains to be answered. 
      Along with clinical case assessments, BGC performance during in-vitro simulation was 
      analyzed to further understand mechanisms for optimization of thrombectomy 
      technique.

AB  - Cerebral protection device utilization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been 
      demonstrated to decrease the risk of perioperative stroke. The ProximAl Protection 
      with the MO.MA Device During CaRotid Stenting (ARMOUR) Trial had the lowest event 
      rates of any independently adjudicated study. In this video of two cases of severe 
      carotid artery stenosis, the authors present the nuances of the CAS procedure 
      utilizing a dual-balloon guide catheter device (MO.MA). This device has the benefit 
      of being in place before the lesion is crossed with any device, being able to arrest 
      flow while the atherosclerotic lesion is crossed, and aiding in protection from 
      distal emboli and stroke.The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/0o8DlC1n6_M.

AB  - We present a description of a successful recanalization of an intracranial vessel 
      occlusion by stent retriever-based mechanical thrombectomy with a proximal balloon 
      guide catheter introduced via a transradial access. Therefore, we used the radial 
      artery itself as a natural sheath, as the introduction of a balloon guide catheter 
      would not have been possible through a common radial sheath.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the experience of the FlowGate(2) (FG2) as a new balloon guide 
      catheter in endovascular stroke intervention. METHODS: We evaluated the various 
      outcomes and complications of patients with intracranial large artery occlusion 
      undergoing endovascular stroke intervention with FG2 at our center. Baseline 
      characteristics (failure rate of device application, sex, age, risk factors, 
      arterial occlusion sites, and time intervals) were reviewed. Outcomes were evaluated 
      according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, modified Rankin Scale 
      (mRS) score, number of stent passages required, and Thrombolysis in Cerebral 
      Infarction score. The incidence of hemorrhage, vessel damage, distal emboli, and 
      mortality rate were evaluated as indicators of complications. RESULTS: Overall, 70 
      patients were enrolled, except the 2 patients with application failure of FG2. 
      Seventy patients with a median age of 69 years were treated with FG2. Arterial 
      occlusion involved the M1 (50%) and M2 (14.3%) segments, internal carotid artery 
      (25.7%), and posterior circulation (10%). Median value of mRS at 90 days was 2.8, 
      and 37 patients (52.8%) had a mRS score ≤2. The recanalization rate in patients with 
      a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3 was 91.4%. The hemorrhage 
      rate was 5.7%, but none were symptomatic. In terms of complications, distal emboli 
      occurred in 4.3% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular stroke intervention with the 
      FG2 is safe and effective with good accessibility and less occurrence of distal 
      emboli. Its trackability, stability, and luminal size make the FG2 suitable for 
      stroke intervention.

TI  - Simple aspiration with balloon catheter technique (simple ABC technique) against 
      proximal internal carotid artery occlusion in cases of cardiogenic cerebral 
      embolism.
PG  - 317-321
LID - 10.1177/1591019917753823 [doi]
AB  - Background In cases of acute ischemic stroke, manual aspiration of the thrombus is 
      commonly performed with a balloon guiding catheter placed in the cervical segment of 
      the internal carotid artery (ICA). However, most manual aspirations using a balloon 
      guiding catheter are combined with inner catheters, as in the direct aspiration 
      first pass technique (ADAPT). We experienced some cases of acute ischemic stroke 
      with proximal ICA occlusion due to cardiogenic thrombus where we obtained sufficient 
      recanalization by simple manual aspiration from inflated Optimo 9F balloon catheters 
      (Tokai Medical Products, Japan) placed in the origin of the cervical segment of the 
      ICA without any inner catheter or stent retriever. We perform by preference this 
      procedure, named the simple Aspiration with Balloon Catheter (simple ABC) technique. 
      Herein, we report two recent cases and discuss this procedure. Case presentation 
      Case 1: An 80-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed left ICA 
      occlusion. We performed the simple ABC technique and obtained a large amount of dark 
      red and white thrombus. Puncture-to-reperfusion time was 14 minutes with 
      Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade 3. Case 2: A 69-year-old man with 
      chronic atrial fibrillation developed left internal carotid occlusion. We performed 
      the simple ABC technique and obtained a large amount of dark red thrombus. 
      Puncture-to-reperfusion time was 15 minutes with TICI grade 2b. Conclusion The 
      simple ABC technique is useful to deal with a large amount of thrombus, shortens 
      procedure time, enables less invasive thrombectomy, and can shift immediately to 
      subsequent procedures such as delivering a stent retriever or ADAPT.

TI  - Influence of Thrombus Composition on Thrombectomy: ADAPT vs. Balloon Guide Catheter 
      and Stent Retriever in a Flow Model.
PG  - 257-263
LID - 10.1055/a-0998-4246 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE:  A first-pass, direct aspiration technique and stent retrieval with a 
      balloon guide catheter represent advanced thrombectomy techniques that are 
      increasingly being used in the clinical routine. The purpose of this experimental 
      study was to evaluate whether the techniques' effectiveness depended on the clot 
      composition and to visualize the interaction between the devices and the clot. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Erythrocyte-rich (red) and fibrin-rich (white) clots were 
      placed into the M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery in a transparent vascular 
      phantom with physiological architecture. Physiological hemodynamic conditions were 
      maintained with a programmable pump. On the one hand direct aspiration with a 5F 
      aspiration catheter (ADAPT) and on the other hand stent retrieval with a balloon 
      guide catheter (flow arrest/reversal) was performed. The experiments were made under 
      direct visual control to observe the interaction between the devices and the clot. 
      The primary end points were the number of passes/maneuvers and the occurrence of 
      distal emboli and emboli in a new territory (anterior cerebral artery), until full 
      recanalization was achieved. The experiment was filmed with a full high-definition 
      camera identifying emboli. RESULTS:  Six experiments were conducted for each 
      technique and clot model. Red clots were retrieved by ADAPT with fewer passes and 
      distal emboli, and could usually be aspirated directly at the occlusion site. White 
      clots clogged the tip of the 5F aspiration catheter in every experiment. The 
      catheter had to be pulled back into the long sheath in the cervical internal carotid 
      artery, producing distal emboli. White clots were retrieved by the stent retriever 
      and balloon guide catheter with fewer distal emboli. There was no difference in the 
      number of passes. The stent-thrombus interaction was superficial in both clot 
      models. Successful retrieval was granted by the flow arrest and proximal 
      aspiration/flow reversal. One embolus in a new territory developed when using each 
      technique in white clots. CONCLUSION:  This experimental study showed that the 
      efficacy of advanced thrombectomy techniques might depend on clot composition. 
      Identifying the right technique for the right clot might improve the results of 
      thrombectomy. In a clinical setting the thrombus morphology in non-enhanced CT could 
      be used as a marker for patient selection. KEY POINTS:   · The efficacy of 
      thrombectomy seems to depend on thrombus composition.. · ADAPT might be more 
      effective for rbc-rich clots.. · Thrombectomy with BGC might be more effective for 
      fibrin-rich clots.. CITATION FORMAT: · Madjidyar J, Pineda Vidal L, Larsen N et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The stabilization of a guide catheter is an important factor for 
      performing successful neurointerventional procedures. We present our technique for 
      navigating guide catheters using parent and child balloons. METHODS: In 9 patients 
      with severe atherosclerosis or anatomic variations such as a bovine arch, 8-9-F 
      balloon-mounted guide catheters were navigated using balloon-attached guidewires. 
      Both balloons were used complementarily for flow navigation and vessel fixation at 
      the appropriate positions and times. RESULTS: In all cases, the balloon guide 
      catheter could be inserted up to the required positions, and the procedures were 
      completed without any complications. CONCLUSIONS: The parent and child balloon 
      technique is useful for inserting guide catheters in hostile vascular anatomies.

TI  - Retrograde suction decompression of a large internal carotid aneurysm using a 
      balloon guide catheter combined with a blood-returning circuit and STA-MCA bypass: a 
      technical note.
PG  - 351-355
LID - 10.1007/s10143-016-0808-6 [doi]
AB  - It is difficult to treat large internal carotid aneurysms with simple surgical 
      clipping. Here, we present a retrograde suction decompression (RSD) procedure for 
      large internal carotid aneurysms using a balloon guide catheter combined with a 
      blood-returning circuit and a superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery 
      (STA-MCA) bypass.All patients underwent an STA-MCA bypass before the temporary 
      occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA). A 6-French sheath was inserted into 
      the common carotid artery (CCA), and a 6-French Patrive balloon catheter was placed 
      into the ICA 5 cm past the bifurcation. Aneurysm exposure was obtained; temporary 
      clips were placed on the proximal M1, A1, and posterior communicating (Pcom) 
      segments; and an extension tube was then connected to the balloon catheter. A 
      three-way stopcock was placed, and aspiration was performed through the device to 
      collapse the aneurysm. The aspirated blood was returned to a venous line with an 
      added heparin to prevent anemia after aspiration. During the decompression, the 
      blood flow to the cortical area was supplied through the STA-MCA bypass. After the 
      aneurysm collapse, the surgeon carefully dissected the perforating artery from the 
      aneurysm dome or neck, and permanent clips were then placed on the aneurysm neck. 
      Our procedure has several advantages, such as STA-MCA bypass without external 
      carotid artery occlusion for preventing ischemic complications of the cortical area, 
      anemia may be avoided because of the return of the aspirated blood, and a hybrid 
      operation room is not required to perform this method.

TI  - Balloon guide catheter improves revascularization and clinical outcomes with the 
      Solitaire device: analysis of the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke Registry.
PG  - 141-5
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.002407 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Efficient and timely recanalization is an important goal in 
      acute stroke endovascular therapy. Several studies demonstrated improved 
      recanalization and clinical outcomes with the stent retriever devices compared with 
      the Merci device. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of the balloon 
      guide catheter (BGC) and recanalization success in a substudy of the North American 
      Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. METHODS: The investigator-initiated NASA 
      registry recruited 24 clinical sites within North America to submit demographic, 
      clinical, site-adjudicated angiographic, and clinical outcome data on consecutive 
      patients treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device. BGC use was at the 
      discretion of the treating physicians. RESULTS: There were 354 patients included in 
      the NASA registry. BGC data were reported in 338 of 354 patients in this 
      subanalysis, of which 149 (44%) had placement of a BGC. Mean age was 67.3±15.2 
      years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18. Patients 
      with BGC had more hypertension (82.4% versus 72.5%; P=0.05), atrial fibrillation 
      (50.3% versus 32.8%; P=0.001), and were more commonly administered tissue 
      plasminogen activator (51.6% versus 38.8%; P=0.02) compared with patients without 
      BGC. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture and number of passes were similar 
      between the 2 groups. Procedure time was shorter in patients with BGC (120±28.5 
      versus 161±35.6 minutes; P=0.02), and less adjunctive therapy was used in patients 
      with BGC (20% versus 28.6%; P=0.05). Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 
      reperfusion scores were higher in patients with BGC (53.7% versus 32.5%; P<0.001). 
      Distal emboli and emboli in new territory were similar between the 2 groups. 
      Discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (mean, 12±14.5 versus 
      17.5±16; P=0.002) and good clinical outcome at 3 months were superior in patients 
      with BGC compared with patients without (51.6% versus 35.8%; P=0.02). Multivariate 
      analysis demonstrated that the use of BGC was an independent predictor of good 
      clinical outcome (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Use of a BGC with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device resulted in superior 
      revascularization results, faster procedure times, decreased need for adjunctive 
      therapy, and improved clinical outcome.

TI  - Stent retriever thrombectomy with the Cover accessory device versus proximal 
      protection with a balloon guide catheter: in vitro stroke model comparison.
PG  - 413-7
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011617 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, an in vitro cerebrovascular occlusion model of the 
      intracranial circulation was developed for testing thrombectomy devices. The Cover 
      accessory (Lazarus Effect; Campbell, California, USA) is a novel nitinol braided 
      mesh device that surrounds the stent retrieval device and thrombus during the 
      retrieval process to help prevent clot fragmentation and embolization. METHODS: 
      Using the in vitro model, after introducing fresh clot into the middle cerebral 
      artery, we compared rates of target vessel recanalization and embolization in new 
      territories (areas in which clot had not been introduced) achieved with the 
      Solitaire Flow Restoration (FR) stent retriever (Covidien, Irvine, California) in 
      conjunction with the use of a conventional guide catheter (control group), a balloon 
      guide catheter (BGC group), and the Cover device (Cover group). RESULTS: In a total 
      of 51 thrombectomy experiments (20 in the control group, 20 in the BGC group, and 11 
      in the Cover group), successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 
      2b-3) was achieved more frequently in the Cover group than in the control group or 
      in the BGC group (p=0.047 and p=0.020, respectively). Embolization of new 
      (previously unaffected) territories occurred in five (25%) experiments from the 
      control group and in three (15%) experiments from the BGC group, whereas no 
      embolization of new territories was seen with Cover device assisted thrombectomy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Application of the Cover device in this experimental model resulted in 
      higher successful recanalization rates, no embolic events, and was more effective 
      than use of the conventional guide catheter or BGC.

      burden reduction in endovascular therapy for ICA L/T occlusion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Timely recanalization during endovascular procedures for acute 
      ischemic stroke can be challenging in cases with large clot burden, such as those 
      encountered in the terminal internal carotid T- or L-type occlusion. METHODS: A 
      novel but simple technique to achieve fast reduction in clot burden in stroke 
      patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery termination is described 
      where manual suction using a 60-ml syringe applied through an 8-F balloon guide 
      catheter positioned in the cervical carotid vasculature with proximal flow arrest 
      allows subsequent revascularization of the residual middle cerebral artery clot. 
      RESULTS: The use of manual suction through a balloon-tipped guide catheter in 
      internal carotid artery L- or T-type occlusion is illustrated. This resulted in a 
      significant reduction of the clot burden and facilitated further interventions 
      leading to full recanalization. CONCLUSION: Manual suction using a 60-ml syringe 
      through a balloon guide catheter is a useful and feasible technique that facilitates 
      thrombectomy of large burden cerebral clots.

TI  - Effective use of balloon guide catheters in reducing incidence of mechanical 
      thrombectomy related distal embolization.
PG  - 1671-1677
LID - 10.1007/s00701-017-3256-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical benefit of endovascular stroke therapy has been 
      demonstrated in several prospective randomized trials. However, in a relevant 
      percentage of patients, mechanical thrombectomy bears the risk of causing new 
      infarction in initially unaffected vascular territories through thrombus 
      fragmentation and migration of clot debris. The goal of this study was to evaluate 
      the use of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) to effectively achieve flow arrest and 
      thrombus aspiration during the intervention to avoid distal embolization. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was performed in 139 patients between October 2010 and May 2016 
      to analyze occlusions in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery 
      (ICA) by using a stent retriever with a BGC (n = 73) or a non-BGC (n = 66). The 
      following data were collected: patient age and gender, along with history of 
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, smoking, obesity, 
      dyslipidemia, and previous ischemic stroke. Data on procedure time, number of 
      passes, and angiographic findings were also collected. The final reperfusion score 
      was rated based on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grading scale. 
      Successful recanalization was defined as TICI 3 or 2b. RESULTS: A total of 139 
      patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the stent retriever. Of the 139 
      patients, 73 (52.5%) underwent placement of a BGC. The mean age was 
      65.8 ± 13.5 years, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
      score was 11. The average initial NIHSS score was lower in the BGC group compared 
      with the non-BGC group (mean, 11.2 ± 5.6 vs. 13.2 ± 5.6; P = 0.03). Patients with 
      BGC had fewer incidences of previous ischemic stroke (12.3% vs. 28.8%; P = 0.01). 
      The numbers of passes were similar between the two groups. The procedure time 
      (99 ± 49.4 min vs. 124 ± 72.2 min; P = 0.02) and the time from onset of symptoms to 
      procedure end (302 ± 102 min vs. 357.2 ± 136.1 min; P = 0.009) were shorter in the 
      BGC group. TICI 3 or 2b recanalization scores were higher in the BGC group compared 
      to the non-BGC group [63/73, 86.3% vs. 48/66, 72.7%; odds ratio (OR), 0.6; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 0.2-1.4; P = 0.04]. Importantly, distal embolization was 
      less frequent in the BGC group (5/73, 6.8% vs. 21/66, 31.8%; OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 
      2.2-18.0; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of distal embolization was significantly 
      decreased with the use of a BGC.

TI  - Effect of Balloon Guide Catheter Utilization on the Incidence of Sub-angiographic

      Observational Study.

AB  - Background: Thrombus fragmentation causing distal emboli is a feared complication 
      during mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We aimed to investigate the impact of 
      procedural parameters and thrombus properties on the incidence of peripheral emboli 
      after MT for large vessel occlusions (LVO). Methods: We performed a prospective 
      analysis of patients with LVO stroke successfully treated with MT, defined as a 
      score of 2b, 2c, or 3 on the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scale. A 
      follow-up MRI including high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was 
      performed within 24 h following MT. The primary endpoint was the number and volume 
      of peripheral emboli, classified as punctuate DWI lesions distant to the 
      diffusion-restricted core lesion. Further analysis included the influence of 
      baseline characteristics, procedural and outcome parameters, and thrombus properties 
      on peripheral emboli. Results: Thirty-seven patients with successful MT met the 
      inclusion criteria. Use of a balloon guide catheter (BGC) and TICI were the only 
      independent predictors for a reduced number of peripheral emboli. The use of a BGC 
      led to a significant reduction in the number and volume of peripheral emboli, with a 
      median number/volume of peripheral emboli of 4.5/287 μl (IQR 1.25-8.25/76-569 μl) 
      vs. 12/938 μl (IQR 4-19/242-1,836 μl). In cases where BGC was not employed, the 
      number of peripheral emboli increased with decreasing TICI scores. Conclusions: 
      BGC-aided MT reduces the number of peripheral emboli in successful but incomplete 
      reperfusion (TICI 2b and 2c). The effectiveness of this strategy therefore goes 
      above and beyond that which can be demonstrated by the TICI score alone.

TI  - TREVO stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke secondary to 
      large vessel occlusion registry.
PG  - 516-524
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated the efficacy of 
      mechanical thrombectomy using stent-retrievers in patients with acute ischemic 
      stroke (AIS) with large vessel occlusions; however, it remains unclear if these 
      results translate to a real-world setting. The TREVO Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke 
      (TRACK) multicenter Registry aimed to evaluate the use of the Trevo device in 
      everyday clinical practice. METHODS: Twenty-three centers enrolled consecutive AIS 
      patients treated from March 2013 through August 2015 with the Trevo device. The 
      primary outcome was deﬁned as achieving a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 
      score of ≥2b. Secondary outcomes included 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 
      mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). RESULTS: A total of 
      634patients were included. Mean age was 66.1±14.8 years and mean baseline NIH Stroke 
      Scale (NIHSS) score was 17.4±6.7; 86.7% had an anterior circulation occlusion. Mean 
      time from symptom onset to puncture and time to revascularization were 
      363.1±264.5 min and 78.8±49.6 min, respectively. 80.3% achieved TICI ≥2b. 90-day mRS 
      ≤2 was achieved in 47.9%, compared with 51.4% when restricting the analysis to the 
      anterior circulation and within 6 hours (similar to recent AHA/ASA guidelines), and 
      54.3% for those who achieved complete revascularization. The 90-day mortality rate 
      was 19.8%. Independent predictors of clinical outcome included age, baseline NIHSS, 
      use of balloon guide catheter, revascularization, and sICH. CONCLUSION: The TRACK 
      Registry results demonstrate the generalizability of the recent thrombectomy RCTs in 
      real-world clinical practice. No differences in clinical and angiographic outcomes 
      were shown between patients treated within the AHA/ASA guidelines and those treated 
      outside the recommendations.

TI  - Vertebral Artery Patency and Thrombectomy in Basilar Artery Occlusions.
PG  - 389-395
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.022466 [doi]
AB  - Background and Purpose- Factors influencing recanalization success in basilar artery 
      occlusions are largely unknown. Preliminary evidence has suggested that flow arrest 
      in the vertebral artery contralateral to the catheter bearing vertebral artery may 
      facilitate recanalization. The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of 
      anatomic variations and flow conditions on recanalization success in basilar artery 
      occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Methods- Consecutive basilar artery 
      occlusions treated with second-generation thrombectomy devices at a single-center 
      were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patients' characteristics, occlusion length, 
      collateral circulation, underlying stenosis, incomplete occlusions, and patency of 
      the vertebral arteries were analyzed with regards to recanalization success. 
      Aplastic or hypoplastic vertebral artery contralateral to the catheter position was 
      defined as contralateral low flow condition. Logistic regression analysis was used 
      to examine the association between anatomic variations and flow conditions in 
      relation to complete recanalization and the modified Rankin Scale score while 
      controlling for several potentially confounding variables. Clinical impact was 
      evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3. Results- One hundred fifteen 
      patients were included (mean age 71.5±12.8, m:f=2:1, median National Institutes of 
      Health Stroke Scale =15, interquartile range =10-22). Complete recanalization was 
      more often observed in patients with contralateral low flow conditions (80.6% versus 
      50.0%), which remained an independent predictor of complete recanalization in 
      multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.97-17.19). Patients 
      with complete posterior recanalization had lower in-hospital mortality (16.4% versus 
      41.7%) and more often achieved modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3 (49.4% versus 
      8.3%), even after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 15.93; 
      95% CI, 1.42-179.00). Conclusions- Contralateral low flow condition (vertebral 
      artery aplasia or hypoplasia) seems to be an independent factor for fewer distal 
      emboli and complete recanalization in basilar artery occlusion patients treated by 
      modern endovascular devices. Complete recanalization reflecting the absence of 
      peri-interventional clot fragmentation brings clear clinical benefit. Further 
      studies are warranted to evaluate the need for contralateral flow modulation or 
      ipsilateral balloon guide catheter during posterior circulation thrombectomy in 
      patients with bilaterally patent vertebral arteries.

AB  - Background and Purpose- It remains unclear how experience influences outcomes after 
      the advent of stent retriever technology. We studied the relationship between site 
      experience and outcomes in the Trevo Acute Ischemic Stroke multicenter registry. 
      Methods- The 24 sites that enrolled patients in the Trevo Acute Ischemic Stroke 
      registry were trichotomized into low-volume (<2 cases/month), medium-volume (2-4 
      cases/month), and high-volume centers (>4 cases/month). Baseline features, imaging, 
      and clinical outcomes were compared across the 3 volume strata. A multivariable 
      analysis was performed to assess whether outcomes were influenced by site volumes. 
      Results- A total of 624 patients were included and distributed as low- (n=188 
      patients, 30.1%), medium- (n=175, 28.1%), and high-volume (n=261, 41.8%) centers. 
      There were no significant differences in terms of age (mean, 66±16 versus 67±14 
      versus 65±15; P=0.2), baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mean, 
      17.6±6.5 versus 16.8±6.5 versus 17.6±6.9; P=0.43), or occlusion site across the 3 
      groups. Median (interquartile range) times from stroke onset to groin puncture were 
      266 (181.8-442.5), 239 (175-389), and 336.5 (221.3-466.5) minutes in low-, medium-, 
      and high-volume centers, respectively (P=0.004). Higher efficiency and better 
      outcomes were seen in higher volume sites as demonstrated by shorter procedural 
      times (median, 97 versus 67 versus 69 minutes; P<0.001), higher balloon guide 
      catheter use (40% versus 36% versus 59%; P≤0.0001), and higher rates of good outcome 
      (90-day modified Rankin Scale [mRS], ≤2; 39% versus 50% versus 53.4%; P=0.02). There 
      were no appreciable differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or 90-day 
      mortality. After adjustments in the multivariable analysis, there were significantly 
      higher chances of achieving a good outcome in high- versus low-volume (odds ratio, 
      1.67; 95% CI, 1.03-2.7; P=0.04) and medium- versus low-volume (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% 
      CI, 1.1-2.9; P=0.03) centers, but there were no significant differences between 
      high- and medium-volume centers (P=0.86). Conclusions- Stroke center volumes 
      significantly influence efficiency and outcomes in mechanical thrombectomy.

TI  - Procedural approaches and angiographic signs predicting first-pass recanalization in 
      patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke.
PG  - 491-496

AB  - BACKGROUND: First-pass recanalization via mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been 
      associated with improved clinical outcome in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. 
      The optimal approach to achieve first-pass effect (FPE) remains unclear. No study 
      has evaluated angiographic features associated with the achievement of FPE. We aimed 
      to determine the procedural approaches and angiographic signs that may predict FPE. 
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, multi-centre, observational study of FPE in 
      patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with MT between February and June 
      2017. MTs were performed using different devices, deployment manoeuvres (standard 
      versus 'Push and Fluff' technique), proximal balloon guide catheter (PBGC), distal 
      aspiration catheter (DAC) or both. The angiographic clot protrusion sign (ACPS) was 
      recorded. Completed FPE (cFPE) was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral 
      infarction score of 2c-3. Associations were sought between cFPE and procedural 
      approaches and angiographic signs. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients were included. 
      cFPE was achieved in 74 (38.3%) patients. The use of the push and fluff technique 
      (odds ratio (OR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-9.29, p = 0.010), PBGC (OR 
      3.81, 95% CI: 1.41-10.22, p = 0.008) and ACPS (OR 4.71, 95% CI: 1.78-12.44, 
      p = 0.002) were independently associated with cFPE. Concurrence of these three 
      variables led to cFPE in 82 vs 35% of the remaining cases (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The concurrence of the PBGC, the push and fluff technique, and the ACPS was 
      associated with the highest rates of cFPE. Appropriate selection of the thrombectomy 
      device and deployment technique may lead to better procedural outcomes. ACPS could 
      be used to assess clot integration strategies in future trials.

TI  - Under Pressure: Comparison of Aspiration Techniques for Endovascular Mechanical 
      Thrombectomy.
PG  - 905-909
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A5605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood flow should be interrupted during mechanical 
      thrombectomy to prevent embolization of clot fragments. The purpose of our study was 
      to provide a handy overview of the most common aspiration devices and to quantify 
      their flow characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed volumetric flow rates 
      generated by a 60-mL VacLok vacuum pressure syringe, a Pump MAX aspiration pump, and 
      a Dominant Flex suction pump connected to the following: 1) an 8F long sheath, 2) an 
      8F balloon-guide catheter, 3) an ACE 64 distal aspiration catheter, and 4) an AXS 
      Catalyst 6 Distal Access Catheter. We used a water/glycerol solution, which was kept 
      at a constant temperature of 20°C (viscosity, 3.7 mPa · s). RESULTS: Aspiration with 
      the syringe and the Dominant Flex suction pump achieved the highest flows, whereas 
      aspiration with the Pump MAX was significantly lower (P < .001). Resistors in the 
      aspiration system (tubing, connectors, and so forth) restricted flows, especially 
      when the resistance of the catheter was small (due to its large diameter) and the 
      connected resistors became the predominant resistance (P < .001). The syringe 
      achieved an average vacuum pressure of -90 kPa, and the resulting flow was constant 
      during almost the entire procedure of filling the syringe. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sixty-milliliter VacLok vacuum pressure syringes and the Dominant Flex suction pump 
      achieved high and constant flows likely sufficient to reverse blood flow during 
      thrombectomy with an 8F sheath or balloon-guide catheter in the ICA and modern 
      distal aspiration catheters in the MCA. The Pump MAX aspiration pump is dedicated 
      for use with distal aspiration catheters and is unlikely to reverse blood flow in 
      the ICA and MCA without balloon protection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive evidence supports mechanical thrombectomy using stentrievers 
      (SR) for acute large vessel occlusion (aLVO). Aspiration is also used as a first 
      pass or adjunct technique during clot removal. Here we report technical results from 
      mechanical thrombectomy cases using SR alone, aspiration alone (AD), or a 
      combination of SR and aspiration (SA) as a first pass for aLVO. METHODS: An 
      institutional stroke database was reviewed for patients presenting to a single 
      academic institution with anterior circulation aLVO and who were treated with 
      mechanical thrombectomy from 2011 to 2017. Patients managed with SR alone, AD, or a 
      combination of these 2 techniques (SA) were identified. The rate of successful 
      recanalization after the first thrombectomy attempt was compared between the 3 
      groups. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients were analyzed, including 215 in SR, 32 in 
      AD, and 106 in SA groups. There was no significant difference for age and admission 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale between the groups. Successful 
      recanalization rates after the first pass were 35.8% in the SR group, 34.4% in 
      aspiration as a first pass technique, and 55.7% in SA, with a statistically 
      significant higher rate of first pass success in the SA group (P = 0.002). Using 
      balloon-guide catheter doubled the rate of successful first pass recanalization from 
      21.3% to 41.6% in the SR group (P = 0.005); however, the SA technique was more 
      effective for first pass recanalization when compared with an SR and balloon-guide 
      catheter combination (55.7% vs. 41.6%, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      SR and catheter aspiration can increase the rate of single pass successful 
      recanalization compared with these techniques individually.

TI  - Predictors of Successful First-Pass Thrombectomy with a Balloon Guide Catheter: 
      Results of a Decision Tree Analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s12975-020-00784-2 [doi]
AB  - Complete recanalization after a single retrieval maneuver is an interventional goal 
      in acute ischemic stroke and an independent factor for good clinical outcome. 
      Anatomical biomarkers for predicting clot removal difficulties have not been 
      comprehensively analyzed and await unused. We retrospectively evaluated 200 
      consecutive patients who suffered acute stroke and occlusion of the anterior 
      circulation and were treated with mechanical thrombectomy through a balloon guide 
      catheter (BGC). The primary objective was to evaluate the influence of carotid 
      tortuosity and BGC positioning on the one-pass Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral 
      Infarction Scale (mTICI) 3 rate, and secondarily, the influence of communicating 
      arteries on the angiographic results. After the first-pass mTICI 3, recanalization 
      fell from 51 to 13%. The regression models and decision tree (supervised machine 
      learning) results concurred: carotid tortuosity was the main constraint on efficacy, 
      reducing the likelihood of mTICI 3 after one pass to 30%. BGC positioning was 
      relevant only in carotid arteries without elongation: BGCs located in the distal 
      internal carotid artery (ICA) had a 70% probability of complete recanalization after 
      one pass, dropping to 43% if located in the proximal ICA. These findings demonstrate 
      that first-pass mTICI 3 is influenced by anatomical and interventional factors 
      capable of being anticipated, enabling the BGC technique to be adapted to patient's 
      anatomy to enhance effectivity.

TI  - Retrograde suction decompression of giant paraclinoid aneurysms using a No. 7 French 
      balloon-containing guide catheter. Technical note.
PG  - 479-81
AB  - The treatment of large and giant paraclinoid carotid artery (CA) aneurysms often 
      requires the use of suction decompression for safe and effective occlusion. Both 
      open and endovascular suction decompression techniques have been described 
      previously. In this article the authors describe a revised endovascular suction 
      decompression technique that provides several advantages in the treatment of large 
      and giant paraclinoid and CA aneurysms. A 51-year-old woman presented with a 
      relatively brief history of progressive visual loss in the right eye, nonspecific 
      headache, and an afferent pupillary defect. After angiography studies had been 
      obtained, it was determined that she had a giant right paraclinoid internal CA 
      aneurysm with a dome size of approximately 26 mm on the right and a neck diameter of 
      10 mm. A modified technique was performed in which suction decompression was used. 
      With the aid of a No. 7 French Concentric balloon guide catheter (Concentric 
      Medical, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and application of a temporary clip distal to the 
      aneurysm, the aneurysm was trapped and decompressed using retrograde suction through 
      the guide catheter when the balloon was inflated. After satisfactory placement of 
      three permanent clips, an intraoperative angiogram obtained through the same guide 
      catheter confirmed CA patency. The aneurysm was then punctured and aspirated, 
      ensuring complete occlusion of the aneurysm sac and reconstruction of the parent 
      vessel. The patient made an excellent recovery and did not suffer any complications. 
      She did not experience worsening in her vision. This technical modification to 
      endovascular suction decompression allows several potential advantages, including 
      higher volume decompression and the ability to deliver endovascular devices to 
      distal arterial locations.

AB  - GOALS: While mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been shown to be effective in the 
      treatment of acute large vessel occlusions, adjunctive measures, such as balloon 
      guide catheters (BGC) and aspiration techniques, are utilized heterogeneously. 
      Clarifying the effects of aspiration applied to the anterior cerebral circulation 
      with proximal flow arrest can shed light on embolic protection during MT. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Manual and pump aspiration were applied through a BGC in a synthetic 
      cerebrovascular model with a 60 ml syringe and a Penumbra pump, respectively. Flow 
      direction was observed during the procedure with fluorescent particles and 
      ultraviolet light. Flow rates were monitored at the simulated internal carotid 
      artery and middle cerebral artery (MCA). FINDINGS: Both aspiration methods produced 
      retrograde flow in all the modeled cerebrovascular segments. In the syringe 
      aspiration methods, an interval phase occurred during the experimental trial in 
      which suction forces paused and MCA flow became anterograde through posterior 
      communication artery collateral circulation. CONCLUSION: Flow patterns vary with 
      different methods of aspiration. With proximal flow arrest, continuous aspiration 
      methods induce constant retrograde flow in all vessels, whereas manual aspiration 
      demonstrates various flow changes, including periods of anterograde flow during the 
      procedure, which may be less effective at distal re-embolization prevention.

TI  - Reduction in distal emboli with proximal flow control during mechanical 
      thrombectomy: a quantitative in vitro study.
PG  - 1396-401
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.670463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of proximal flow control on efficacy 
      and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in an in vitro middle cerebral artery 
      occlusion. METHODS: Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci 
      Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon guide catheter, 
      were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of 
      distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the 
      recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS: Use of the balloon guide 
      catheter during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the 
      formation of large distal emboli with a diameter >1 mm, regardless of the device 
      used (P<0.01). Applying aspiration via the balloon guide catheter in place of the 
      conventional guide catheter resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal 
      (P<0.0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced 
      immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69.2 ± 27.3 
      and 45.5 ± 22.8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation 
      because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment 
      but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After 
      thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The 
      Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal 
      compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional guide catheter was used (1.5 
      versus 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of distal embolization was significantly reduced 
      with the use of the balloon guide catheter.

TI  - Comparison of modern stroke thrombectomy approaches using an in vitro 
      cerebrovascular occlusion model.
PG  - 547-51
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A4149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A new in vitro cerebrovascular occlusion model of the 
      intracranial circulation was developed recently for testing thrombectomy devices. 
      Using this model, we compared recanalization success associated with different 
      modern endovascular thrombectomy approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Model 
      experiments were performed in 4 thrombectomy test groups: 1) primary or direct 
      Stentriever thrombectomy with a conventional guide catheter (control group), 2) 
      primary Stentriever thrombectomy with a balloon-guide catheter, 3) combined 
      Stentriever-continuous aspiration approach, and 4) direct aspiration alone. 
      Successful recanalization was defined as a TICI score of 2b or 3. RESULTS: 
      Seventy-one thrombectomy experiments were conducted. Similar rates of TICI 2b-3 
      scores were achieved with balloon-guide and conventional guide catheters (P = .34). 
      The combined Stentriever plus aspiration approach and the primary aspiration 
      thrombectomy resulted in significantly higher rates of TICI 2b or 3 than the 
      conventional guide-catheter approach in the control group (P = .008 and P = .0001, 
      respectively). The primary Stentriever thrombectomy with the conventional guide 
      catheter showed the highest rate of embolization to new territories (53%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Data from our in vitro model experiments show that the Stentriever 
      thrombectomy under continuous aspiration and primary aspiration thrombectomy 
      approaches led to the highest degree of recanalization.

AB  - Surgical treatment of large paraclinoid aneurysms remains technically challenging 
      due to the adjacent bony anatomy and neurovascular structures. Endovascular 
      retrograde suction decompression using a double-lumen balloon catheter facilitates 
      clip ligation of the aneurysm. Video 1 demonstrates a large paraclinoid aneurysm 
      that was treated with endovascular balloon occlusion and retrograde suction 
      decompression in a hybrid operating room. A 49-year-old woman presented with 
      progressively worsening headache. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a 
      large 16-mm left paraclinoid aneurysm. Neurologic examination showed no deficits. 
      Angiography with compression of the left carotid artery showed the collateral blood 
      flow through the posterior communicating artery. The aneurysm was exposed via the 
      pterional transsylvian approach. A double-lumen balloon guide catheter was placed in 
      the left internal carotid artery. Considering the risk of ischemic complications, 
      the "trapping-evacuation" technique was not used. After balloon inflation, a 
      temporary clip was placed on the posterior communicating artery. Retrograde suction 
      through the guide catheter decreased the intra-aneurysmal pressure. Tandem clipping 
      with fenestrated clips was used to occlude the aneurysm and reconstruct the parent 
      artery. Postoperative angiography confirmed complete obliteration of the aneurysm, 
      and the patient recovered without any neurologic deficits. Endovascular balloon 
      occlusion obviated the need for cervical dissection of the internal carotid artery. 
      Retrograde suction decompression and intraoperative angiography facilitated surgical 
      clipping for large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms.

TI  - Arterial Dissection Following the Use of Remote Aspiration Thrombectomy.
PG  - 417-419
LID - 10.4103/jnrp.jnrp_519_17 [doi]
AB  - Remote aspiration thrombectomy using a balloon guide catheter for acute carotid 
      artery occlusion has been proposed as a safe and effective technique. We present a 
      case of iatrogenic arterial dissection of the distal cervical segment in a patient 
      with proximal vessel occlusion who underwent attempted revascularization using this 
      strategy. A 57-year-old male patient presented with computed tomography (CT) 
      angiogram evidence of a left carotid terminus and M1 segment occlusion. The patient 
      was taken emergently for mechanical thrombectomy. Remote aspiration thrombectomy was 
      attempted twice using manual aspiration through a balloon guide catheter in the 
      common carotid artery; however, this resulted in minimal recanalization of the 
      carotid terminus and a new iatrogenic dissection within the internal carotid artery 
      (ICA) just proximal to the skull base. Despite multiple additional attempts at 
      mechanical thrombectomy, only limited recanalization of the ICA terminus and 
      anterior cerebral artery distribution was achieved, with no significant flow past 
      the M1 segment. After the procedure, a large ischemic territory within the left 
      middle cerebral artery distribution consistent with the continued M1 segment 
      occlusion was apparent on CT. The patient died on the poststroke day 6. Although 
      remote aspiration thrombectomy for thromboemboli in this location has potential 
      benefits, it should be used cautiously given the potential risk of injury to the 
      proximal vasculature.

TI  - Risk of distal embolization with stent retriever thrombectomy and ADAPT.
PG  - 197-202
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a discrepancy in clinical outcomes and the achieved 
      recanalization rates with stent retrievers in the endovascular treatment of ischemic 
      stroke. It is our hypothesis that procedural release of embolic particulate may be 
      one contributor to poor outcomes and is a modifiable risk. The goal of this study is 
      to assess various treatment strategies that reduce the risk of distal emboli. 
      METHODS: Mechanical thrombectomy was simulated in a vascular phantom with collateral 
      circulation. Hard fragment-prone clots (HFC) and soft elastic clots (SECs) were used 
      to generate middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions that were retrieved by the 
      Solitaire FR devices through (1) an 8 Fr balloon guide catheter (BGC), (2) a 5 Fr 
      distal access catheter at the proximal aspect of the clot in the MCA (Solumbra), or 
      (3) a 6 Fr guide catheter with the tip at the cervical internal carotid artery 
      (guide catheter, GC). Results from mechanical thrombectomy were compared with those 
      from direct aspiration using the Penumbra 5MAX catheter. The primary endpoint was 
      the size distribution of emboli to the distribution of the middle and anterior 
      cerebral arteries. RESULTS: Solumbra was the most efficient method for reducing HFC 
      fragments (p<0.05) while BGC was the best method for preventing SEC fragmentation 
      (p<0.05). The risk of forming HFC distal emboli (>1000 µm) was significantly 
      increased using GC. A non-statistically significant benefit of direct aspiration was 
      observed in several subgroups of emboli with size 50-1000 µm. However, compared with 
      the stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy techniques, direct aspiration 
      significantly increased the risk of SEC fragmentation (<50 µm) by at least twofold. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of distal embolization is affected by the catheterization 
      technique and clot mechanics.

TI  - Microcatheter navigation through the clot: does size matter?
PG  - 271-274
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high recanalization rates achieved with endovascular treatment 
      of acute ischemic strokes, around 50% of eligible patients will not achieve a good 
      outcome. Parameters that may determine patient outcomes include: time from puncture 
      to recanalization, the collateral status, the anesthesia regimen, blood pressure 
      management, and distal emboli. Characterization of distal emboli generated during 
      mechanical thrombectomy has been performed in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: To 
      further investigate the risk of distal embolization associated with microcatheter 
      navigation across the clot. METHODS: A contrast-enhanced clot analog was used in an 
      in vitro model that mimicked a middle cerebral artery occlusion within a complete 
      circle of Willis vascular replica. The clot was crossed with one of the following 
      microcatheters: Pro18, XT-27 or 3MAX. The emboli generated during the procedure were 
      collected and measured. RESULTS: The use of Pro18 and XT-27 resulted in a 
      significant reduction of visible particles (size ≥500 µm) as compared with the 3MAX 
      catheter (P<0.003). For the size range between 8 and 200 µm, there was a trend for 
      Pro18 to generate fewer particles (-18%) than XT-27 but without statistical 
      significance (P>0.05). In comparison with previously published data, acquired under 
      the same conditions, it was found that the clot crossing maneuver accounts 
      approximately for 12% of the total number of small emboli (<200 µm) induced during a 
      stent retriever-mediated mechanical thrombectomy procedure via a balloon guide 
      catheter. CONCLUSIONS: The clot crossing maneuver has a significant effect on the 
      total number of small particles induced during mechanical thrombectomy. Smaller 
      microcatheter sizes should be favored when possible.

TI  - Active Reperfusion Hemorrhage during Thrombectomy: Angiographic Findings and 
      Real-Time Correlation with the CT "Spot Sign".
PG  - 370-377
LID - 10.1159/000488084 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage represents one of the most feared 
      complications of endovascular reperfusion. We aim to describe a series of patients 
      that experienced immediate reperfusion injury with active intraprocedural 
      extravasation within the territory of the deep penetrating arteries and provide 
      real-time correlation with CT "spot sign." METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      analysis of patients that suffered reperfusion injury with active arterial 
      extravasation during endovascular stroke treatment in two tertiary care centers. 
      RESULTS: Five patients were identified. Median age was 63 (58-71) years, 66% were 
      male. Median NIHSS was 13.5 (9.5-23.0), platelet level 212,000 (142,000-235,000), 
      baseline systolic blood pressure 152 (133-201) mm Hg, and non-contrast CT ASPECTS 
      7.0 (6.5-9.0). Two patients were taking aspirin and one had received intravenous 
      thrombolysis. There were three middle cerebral artery M1, one internal carotid 
      artery terminus, and one vertebrobasilar junction occlusion. Three patients had 
      anterior circulation tandem occlusions. Stroke etiology was extracranial 
      atherosclerosis (n = 2), intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 2), and cervical 
      dissection (n = 1). The median time from onset to puncture was 5.5 (3.9-8.6) h. 
      Intravenous heparin was administered in all patients (median dose of 4,750 
      [3,250-6,000] units) and intravenous abciximab in four. All tandem cases had the 
      cervical lesion addressed first. Four lenticulostriates and one paramedian pontine 
      artery were involved. Intraprocedural flat-panel CT was performed in four (80%) 
      cases and provided real-time correlation between the active contrast extravasation 
      and the "spot sign." The bailout included use of protamine, blood pressure control, 
      and balloon guide catheter or intracranial compliant balloon inflation plus coiling 
      of targeted vessel. All patients had angiographic cessation of bleeding at the end 
      of the procedure with parenchymal hemorrhage type 1 in one case and type 2 in four. 
      Three patients had modified Rankin score of 4 and two were dead at 90 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Active reperfusion hemorrhage involving perforator arteries was 
      observed to correlate with the CT "spot sign" and to be associated with poor 
      outcomes.

TI  - Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes with the Combined Local Aspiration and Retriever 
      in the North American Solitaire Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) Registry.
PG  - 26-35

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various techniques are used to enhance the results of mechanical 
      thrombectomy with stent-retrievers, including proximal arrest with balloon guide 
      catheter (BGC), conventional large bore proximal catheter (CGC), or in combination 
      with local aspiration through a large-bore catheter positioned at the clot interface 
      (Aspiration-Retriever Technique for Stroke [ARTS]). We evaluated the impact of ARTS 
      in the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. SUMMARY: Data on the 
      use of the aspiration technique were available for 285 anterior circulation 
      patients, of which 29 underwent ARTS technique, 131 CGC, and 125 BGC. Baseline 
      demographics were comparable, except that ARTS patients are less likely to have 
      hypertension or atrial fibrillation. The ARTS group had more ICA occlusions (41.4 
      vs. 22% in the BGC, p = 0.04 and 26% in CGC, p = 0.1) and less MCA/M1 occlusions 
      (44.8 vs. 68% in BGC and 62% in CGC). Time from arterial puncture to reperfusion or 
      end of procedure with ARTS was shorter than with CGC (54 vs. 91 min, p = 0.001) and 
      was comparable to the BGC time (54 vs. 67, p = 0.11). Final degree of reperfusion 
      was comparable among the groups (TICI [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction] 
      score 2b or higher was 72 vs. 70% for CGC vs. 78% for BGC). Procedural 
      complications, mortality, and good clinical outcome at 90 days were similar between 
      the groups. KEY MESSAGES: The ARTS mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke 
      patients appears to yield better results as compared to the use of CGCs with no 
      significant difference when compared to BGC. This early ARTS technique NASA registry 
      data are limited by the earlier generation distal large bore catheters and small 
      sample size. Future studies should focus on the comparison of ARTS and BGC 
      techniques.

TI  - Angiographic Patterns and Outcomes Achieved by Proximal Balloon Occlusion in 
      Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis Stenting.
LID - 10.1007/s00062-019-00770-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The best embolic protection strategy has not yet been 
      established for carotid artery stenting (CAS). This article reports a new simplified 
      approach using a balloon guide catheter inspired by stroke therapy, in patients 
      harboring a symptomatic ICA atherosclerotic stenosis or web. In addition, the three 
      angiographic patterns and clinical outcomes associated with this technique, called 
      the simple flow blockage (SFB) technique are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This 
      was a retrospective study with data extraction from a monocentric prospective 
      clinical registry of consecutive patients admitted for symptomatic ICA stenosis or 
      web. The primary study outcome (composite endpoint) was the rate of occurrence of 
      death, symptomatic stroke or acute coronary syndrome within 30 days of the 
      intervention. RESULTS: In this study 75 symptomatic patients with >50% carotid 
      artery atherosclerotic stenosis or web were included. All procedures were 
      successfully performed. The composite endpoint occurred in 3 patients (4.0%, 95% 
      confidence interval, CI, 0.0-11.3): 1 had symptomatic ischemic stroke, 1 had 
      reperfusion syndrome with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 1 had acute 
      coronary syndrome. After proximal balloon inflation three angiographic patterns were 
      observed: complete contrast column stagnation in the ICA (38.7%), retrograde washout 
      of the ICA from the intracranial circulation towards the external carotid artery 
      (35.5%) and antegrade washout of contrast medium towards the intracranial 
      circulation (25.8%). The median procedure length was 40 min. New asymptomatic 
      ischemic lesions were observed in 22.5% on DWI-MRI. CONCLUSION: The SFB technique 
      enables fast and safe procedures in CAS. A favorable angiographic pattern after 
      proximal balloon inflation was observed in 74.2% of cases.

TI  - Longer stent retrievers enhance thrombectomy performance in acute stroke.
PG  - 6-8
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-013918 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longer stent retrievers have recently become available and have 
      theoretical advantages over their shorter counterparts. We aim to evaluate whether 
      stent retriever length impacts reperfusion rates in stroke thrombectomy. METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected thrombectomy database 
      in which equal diameter (4 mm) stent retrievers were used as the first-line strategy 
      for intracranial internal carotid or middle cerebral artery M1 or M2 occlusions 
      along with a balloon guide catheter from June 2011 to March 2017. The population was 
      dichotomized into long (Trevo 4×30 mm/Solitaire 4×40 mm) or short (Trevo 
      4×20 mm/Solitaire 4×20 mm) retrievers. The primary outcome was first-pass modified 
      Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b/3 reperfusion. RESULTS: Of 1126 
      thrombectomies performed within the study period, 420 were included. Age, gender, 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, ASPECTS, IV tissue plasminogen activator 
      use, stroke etiology, occlusion site, time from last-known-normal to puncture, 
      distribution of Trevo and Solitaire, and the use of newer generation local 
      thromboaspiration devices were comparable between the long and short retrievers. The 
      short retriever group had more frequent hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial 
      fibrillation. First-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion was more common in the long 
      retriever group (62% vs 50%; P=0.01). Parenchymal hematomas type 2, subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage, 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, and mortality were comparable. 
      Multivariable analysis indicated that long retriever (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6; 
      P=0.001), radiopaque device (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4; P=0.003), and adjuvant local 
      aspiration (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3; P=0.003) were independently associated with 
      first-pass reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The use of longer stent retrievers is an 
      independent predictor of first-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion. First-pass reperfusion 
      was also associated with the use of radiopaque devices and adjuvant local 
      aspiration.

TI  - ANCD thrombectomy device: in vitro evaluation.
PG  - 77-81
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-014856 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endovascular treatment of stroke, although highly effective, may fail 
      to reach complete recanalization in around 20% of cases. The Advanced Thrombectomy 
      System (ANCD) is a novel stroke thrombectomy device designed to reduce clot 
      fragmentation and facilitate retrieval by inducing local flow arrest and allowing 
      distal aspiration in combination with a stent retriever. We aimed to assess the 
      preclinical efficacy of ANCD. METHODS: Soft red blood cell (RBC)-rich (n=20/group) 
      and sticky fibrin-rich (n=30/group) clots were used to create middle cerebral artery 
      (MCA) occlusions in two vascular phantoms. Three different treatment strategies were 
      tested: (1) balloon guide catheter + Solitaire (BGC+SR); (2) distal access catheter 
      + SR (DAC+SR); and (3) ANCD+SR, until complete recanalization was achieved or to a 
      maximum of three passes. The recanalization rate was determined after each pass. 
      RESULTS: After one pass, ANCD+SR resulted in an increased recanalization rate (94%) 
      for all clots together compared with BGC+SR (66%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (80%; p=0.04). 
      After the final pass the recanalization rate increased in all three groups but 
      remained higher with ANCD+SR (100%) than with BGC+SR (74%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (90%; 
      p=0.02). The mean number of passes was lower with ANCD+SR (1.06) than with BGC+SR 
      (1.46) or DAC+SR (1.25) (p=0.01). A logistic regression model adjusted for treatment 
      arm, clot type, and model used showed that both RBC-rich clots (OR 8.1, 95% CI 1.6 
      to 13.5) and ANCD+SR (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.8) were independent predictors of 
      first-pass recanalization. CONCLUSION: In in vitro three-dimensional models

AB  - A 40-year-old woman presented to our stroke center for a left middle cerebral artery 
      embolic occlusion. This was successfully treated with mechanical thrombectomy using 
      a stent retriever and balloon guide catheter aspiration. The patient was discharged 
      home in good condition on clopidogrel but returned 2 months later with a 
      contralateral right middle cerebral artery embolic occlusion. This was also 
      successfully treated, this time with a stent retriever and local aspiration (Sol-Arc 
      technique). She was once again discharged in good condition but with warfarin and an 
      implanted loop recorder. This case demonstrates the feasibility of short-term 
      bilateral mechanical thrombectomy for embolic middle cerebral artery occlusions.

PG  - 183-187
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Formation of clot fragments during mechanical thrombectomy for acute 
      ischemic stroke can occlude the distal vasculature, which may reduce the rate of 
      good clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that distal embolization 
      can be reduced using stent retriever thrombectomy in combination with Lazarus Cover 
      technology. METHODS: Hard, fragment-prone clots were used to create middle cerebral 
      artery occlusions in a vascular phantom. Three different treatment strategies using 
      Solitaire FR included: group 1-proximal flow control with an 8F balloon guide 
      catheter (BGC), group 2-thrombectomy through a 6F conventional guide catheter (CGC), 
      and group 3-a similar thrombectomy procedure to group 2 but including the Lazarus 
      Cover device. The primary endpoint was distal emboli quantified by the number and 
      size of the clot debris. RESULTS: The Cover-assisted stent retriever thrombectomy 
      significantly reduced the generation of clot fragments >200 μm as compared with 
      thrombectomy with a CGC, and was similar to the BGC group. Particle size 
      distribution <200 μm was similar across the groups. All groups were associated with 
      high rates of recanalization, with only one failed recanalization with partial clot 
      retention after three passes in one experiment of stent retriever thrombectomy 
      through a CGC. Use of the adjunctive Cover device did not prolong the procedure as 
      compared with control groups. CONCLUSIONS: For a fragment-prone clot, Solitaire 
      thrombectomy in conjunction with the Cover device may lower the risk of distal 
      embolization and is comparable to BGC-protected embolectomy.

TI  - Clot removal therapy by aspiration and extraction for acute embolic carotid 
      occlusion.
PG  - 1521-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of our retrospective study was to investigate 
      the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of clot removal therapy by aspiration and 
      extraction for patients with acute stroke with embolic internal carotid artery (ICA) 
      occlusion. METHODS: Of 814 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted 
      to our institution from March 2003 to April 2005, clot removal therapy was performed 
      for 14. Inclusion criteria were patients (1) presenting within 6 hours of onset of 
      cardioembolic stroke, (2) with serious neurologic symptoms defined by a National 
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 11, (3) without 
      extensive high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted MR images but with decreased 
      ipsilateral hemispheric cerebral blood flow on perfusion-weighted images 
      (perfusion/diffusion mismatch), and (4) with total ICA occlusion on angiograms. We 
      removed clots by aspiration and extraction with a microsnare through either a 
      guiding or balloon guide catheter. Radiographic results, 7-day NIHSS, 3-month 
      modified Rankin Scale, and procedure-related complications were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Of 10 patients treated with the balloon guide catheter to temporarily interrupt 
      proximal flow, 7 obtained complete or partial recanalization. The 4 patients treated 
      with the guiding catheter had no recanalization. Of the 7 patients with 
      recanalization, 6 had favorable 7-day neurologic and 3-month functional outcome; all 
      showed anatomic crossflow via the anterior communicating artery. A procedure-related 
      complication, distal embolization into the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery, 
      occurred in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Balloon guide catheter-assisted clot removal 
      therapy for embolic ICA occlusion may provide a high recanalization rate and good 
      clinical outcome in patients with anatomic crossflow.

LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniocervical catheter access in large vessel occlusion acute ischemic 
      strokes can be challenging in cases of unfavorable aortic arch/cervical vascular 
      anatomy, leading to lower recanalization rates, increased procedural time and worse 
      clinical outcomes. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of the balloon-anchoring 
      technique (BAT) that can be attempted before switching to alternative access sites. 
      METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected information on 11 patients 
      in which two variants of the BAT (proximal anchoring: balloon guide catheter (BGC) 
      is inflated to provide support for distal access; distal anchoring: compliant 
      balloon is inflated in an intracranial artery to allow advancement of the support 
      system) were utilized to facilitate craniocervical access due to failure of 
      conventional maneuvers. RESULTS: Ten patients had anterior and one patient had 
      posterior circulation large vessel occlusions. Mean age was 81 years and 81% were 
      females. Type 3 arches were found in 82% and a 9 French balloon guide catheter was 
      used in 82%. Proximal anchoring with BGC was used in four cases while distal 
      anchoring was used in seven patients to allow access to the target vessel, avoiding 
      the need to puncture alternative access sites. Successful reperfusion (modified 
      treatment in cerebral ischemia 2b-3) was achieved in all cases and no complications 
      were observed. CONCLUSION: BAT is safe and feasible. It can be considered as a 
      rescue maneuver in order to avoid switching to a different access during 
      thrombectomy in individuals with unfavorable aortic arch/craniocervical anatomy.

TI  - Institutional and provider variations for mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment 
      of acute ischemic stroke: a survey analysis.
PG  - 884-890
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014614 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stent retriever combined with aspiration, or the 'Solumbra technique', 
      has recently emerged as one of the popular methods of mechanical thrombectomy (MT). 
      However, the variations in understanding and implementation of the Solumbra 
      technique have not been reported. METHODS: An 18 part anonymous survey questionnaire 
      was designed to extract information regarding technical variations of MT with a 
      focus on the Solumbra technique. The survey link was posted on the Society of 
      Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS) website in 'SNIS connect'. RESULTS: 80 responses 
      were obtained over 4 weeks that were included in the final analysis. Direct 
      aspiration without a balloon guide catheter (BGC) was the most favored technique 
      among respondents (41.12%) followed by the Solumbra technique without a BGC (32.4%). 
      Among those using the Solumbra technique, 77.6% reported that they wait between 2 
      and 5 min to allow clot engagement, 55.2% always remove the microcatheter before 
      aspiration, and 69.1% commence aspiration through the intermediate catheter only 
      when retrieving the stent retriever. Operators who infrequently used or did not use 
      BGCs reported a higher incidence of >80% Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3 
      annual recanalization rates (OR 8.85, 95% CI 2.03 to 38.55, P=0.004) compared with 
      those who consistently used BGCs. CONCLUSION: Our study documents the variations in 
      MT techniques, and more specifically, attempts to quantify variations in the 
      Solumbra technique. The impact of these variations on recanalization rates and

AB  - OBJECTIVEVolume perfusion CT (VPCT) with added CT angiography (CTA)-like 
      reconstruction from VPCT source data (VPCTA) can reveal multiple intracranial 
      parameters. The authors examined the usefulness of VPCTA in terms of reducing the 
      in-hospital time delay for mechanical thrombectomy.METHODSA total of 180 patients 
      who underwent mechanical thrombectomy at the authors' institution between January 
      2014 and March 2017 were divided into 2 groups: a CTA-based thrombectomy decision 
      group (group 1: CTA) and a VPCTA-based decision group (group 2: VPCTA). Multiple 
      time interval categories (from symptom onset to groin puncture, from hospital 
      arrival to groin puncture, procedure time, from symptom onset to reperfusion, and 
      from hospital arrival to reperfusion) were reviewed. All patients underwent clinical 
      assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the 
      modified Rankin Scale, and radiological results were evaluated by the Thrombolysis 
      in Cerebral Infarction score.RESULTSIn all of the time interval categories except 
      for procedure time, the VPCTA group showed a significantly shorter in-hospital time 
      delay during the prethrombectomy period than did the CTA group. The 3-month modified 
      Rankin Scale score was significantly lower in the VPCTA group (2.8) compared with 
      the CTA group (3.5) (p = 0.003). However, there were no statistically significant 
      differences between the 2 groups in the other clinical and radiological 
      outcomes.CONCLUSIONSCompared with CTA, VPCTA significantly reduced the in-hospital 
      time delay during the prethrombectomy period.

TI  - Effects of first pass recanalization on outcomes of contact aspiration thrombectomy.
PG  - 466-470
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: First pass recanalization (FPR, defined as achieving a modified 
      Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) grade 2c/3 with a single pass of a 
      thrombectomy device) effect has not yet been evaluated in contact aspiration 
      thrombectomy (CAT). We evaluated FPR effect on clinical outcomes and FPR predictors 
      in CAT. METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent frontline CAT for anterior 
      circulation large vessel occlusion with recanalization (mTICI 2b-3) were identified 
      from registries at six stroke centers. The patients were dichotomized into FPR and 
      non-FPR groups. Clinical features and outcomes were compared between the groups. 
      Multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether FPR was independently 
      associated with clinical outcomes and to identify predictors of FPR. RESULTS: Of the 
      429 patients who underwent frontline CAT, recanalization was successful in 344 
      patients (80.2%; mean age 68.7±11.0 years; M:F ratio 179:165). The FPR group had a 
      higher rate of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) than the non-FPR 
      group. Furthermore, the good outcome rate was higher in the FPR group than in 
      patients who achieved mTICI 2c/3 with multiple passes or rescue treatment. FPR (OR 
      2.587; 95% CI 1.237 to 5.413) remained independently associated with good outcomes, 
      in addition to age, baseline National Institute Health Stroke Scale, and coronary 
      artery disease. The use of a balloon guide catheter (OR 3.071; 95% CI 1.699 to 
      5.550) was the only predictor of FPR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the FPR group had 
      better clinical outcomes than the non-FPR group in CAT. FPR was independently 
      associated with a good outcome. The use of a balloon guide catheter was the only 
      predictor of FPR.

TI  - North American SOLITAIRE Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke Registry: choice of anesthesia 
      and outcomes.
PG  - 1396-401
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.003698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous work that predated the availability of the safer 
      stent-retriever devices has suggested that general anesthesia (GA) may have a 
      negative impact on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing 
      endovascular therapy. METHODS: We reviewed demographic, clinical, procedural (GA 
      versus local anesthesia [LA], etc), and site-adjudicated angiographic and clinical 
      outcomes data from consecutive patients treated with the Solitaire FR device in the 
      investigator-initiated North American SOLITAIRE Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) 
      Registry. The primary outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Scale, mortality, and 
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients from 18 
      centers were enrolled. GA was used in 69.8% (196/281) of patients. Baseline 
      demographic and procedural factors were comparable between the LA and GA groups, 
      except the former demonstrated longer time-to-groin puncture (395.4±254 versus 
      337.4±208 min; P=0.04), lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; 
      16.2±5.8 versus 18.8±6.9; P=0.002), lower balloon-guide catheter usage (22.4% versus 
      49.2%; P=0.0001), and longer fluoroscopy times (39.5±33 versus 28±22.8 min; 
      P=0.008). Recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2b; 72.94% versus 
      73.6%; P=0.9) and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.1% versus 11.2%; 
      P=0.4) were similar but modified Rankin Scale ≤2 was achieved in more LA patients, 
      52.6% versus 35.6% (odds ratio, 1.4 [1.1-1.8]; P=0.01). In multivariate analysis, 
      hypertension, NIHSS, unsuccessful revascularization, and GA use (odds ratio, 3.3 
      [1.6-7.1]; P=0.001) were associated with death. When only anterior circulation and 
      elective GA patients were included, there was a persistent difference in good 
      outcomes in favor of LA patients (50.7% versus 35.5%; odds ratio, 1.3 [1.01-1.6]; 
      P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The NASA Registry has demonstrated that clinical outcomes and 
      survival are significantly better in patients treated with LA, without increased 
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage risk. Future trials should prospectively 
      evaluate the effect of GA on outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tortuous or occluded vertebral arteries (VAs) can make the endovascular 
      treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency impractical. Bypass surgery is an option, 
      but a craniotomy of the posterior fossa is complicated when physiologic vessels must 
      be abandoned. We report 3 cases of refractory vertebrobasilar insufficiency with 
      different presentations requiring problematic approaches in which the patients were 
      treated by different hybrid strategies. CASE DESCRIPTION: Patient 1 had severe 
      stenosis of right VA ostium with right V1 segment tortuosity and was treated by 
      right VA ostium transposition during which the proximal subclavian artery was 
      blocked by a balloon guide catheter. Patient 2 had severe stenosis of the basilar 
      artery and bilateral VA tortuosity. The V1 segment was exposed and cut open so that 
      an available approach for endovascular procedures was created. Patient 3 had 
      bilateral VA occlusion. After exposure of the left V1 segment, recanalization of the 
      left VA was performed by an interventional radiologist and surgeon working together. 
      All patients had improved hemodynamics and symptoms alleviated without major 
      complications. CONCLUSIONS: For refractory vertebrobasilar insufficiencies, hybrid 
      operations that combine surgical manipulation of the V1 segment and endovascular 
      techniques can be safe and effective.

TI  - Experimental model evaluation of filter trapping after embolectomy using the Merci 
      system: supplemental technique for Merci retrieval procedure.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - Examination of embolectomy using the Merci Retrieval System using experimental 
      stroke models demonstrated that aspiration is not adequate to remove larger clots. 
      The effectiveness of filter trapping was examined using the same models. A silicone 
      model of the carotid artery system with model blood clot was incorporated in a 
      laboratory pulsatile flow system. Embolectomy was performed using the Merci 
      Retrieval System. Any clot not evacuated through the balloon guide catheter was 
      trapped with a distal protection filter device developed for cervical stenting. The 
      clot could not be sucked into the guide catheter by the recommended procedures in 
      nine of 15 trials. Trapping failed in only one trial, in which the clot passed 
      through a gap between the edge of the filter orifice and the inner model lumen. A 
      clot was withdrawn to the catheter tip trapped across the edge of the orifice frame 
      in one trial, and a very large clot was trapped across the filter orifice in two 
      trials. Even clots made by the same method showed variation in properties, 
      especially hardness, which may affect the effectiveness of aspiration. The 
      aspiration procedure recommended for the Merci Retrieval System did not remove the 
      large clots formed by embolectomy. The trapping procedure using a filter device 
      without an orifice frame was effective to solve this problem.

      artery occlusion.
PG  - 1625-31
LID - 10.1007/s00701-011-0999-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe preliminary experiences and the procedural details of 
      retrieval thrombectomy using a self-expanding and fully retrievable Solitaire stent 
      (ev 3 Inc., CA, USA) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large artery 
      occlusions. METHODS: Eight patients with AIS were treated by mechanical thrombectomy 
      using a self-expanding, fully retrievable stent (Solitaire, ev 3 Inc., CA, USA). The 
      stent was deployed to cover the whole intra-arterial clot and then it was slowly 
      retrieved while occluding the internal cerebral artery (ICA) with a balloon guiding 
      catheter. Additionally, continuous negative pressure was applied through the balloon 
      guiding catheter with a specially designed gun device. Occlusion sites were M1 in 
      six cases including one combined supraclinoid ICA occlusion and the other combined 
      M2 occlusion, M2 in 1 case and one basilar artery top. RESULTS: Complete 
      recanalization was achieved in all patients. Procedure time was 45 min or less in 
      seven cases and 70 min in one case. Distal emboli occurred in one case in which the 
      balloon guide catheter was not used. Only in this case was intraarterial 
      fibrinolytics infusion necessary. There was no post-operative intracranial 
      hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, retrieval thrombectomy with the 
      Solitaire stent was a simple and effective method for reopening large cerebral 
      arteries in AIS patients.

TI  - Transarterial Embolization of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula in Superior Sagittal Sinus 
      Under Bilateral External Carotid Artery Flow Control: Technical Note.
PG  - 227-230
LID - S1878-8750(19)31908-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transarterial embolization (TAE) using liquid embolic material is a 
      standard treatment for non-sinus-type dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). However, 
      to reach embolic material over a shunt point for complete obliteration of DAVF is 
      often difficult. We present a technical case report of the efficacy of bilateral 
      external carotid artery (ECA) flow control for the TAE of superior sagittal sinus 
      DAVF. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old man presented with dizziness and left 
      hemiparesis. Computed tomography imaging showed right parietal subcortical 
      hemorrhage, and cerebral angiography revealed a DAVF in the superior sagittal sinus 
      fed by bilateral occipital artery, bilateral superficial temporal artery and 
      bilateral middle meningeal artery (MMA), with cortical venous reflux and without 
      connection to the superior sagittal sinus. We therefore planned TAE using glue via 
      MMA under bilateral ECA flow control. A 7-Fr balloon guide catheter was positioned 
      in the bilateral ECA origins, and a microcatheter was introduced distal to the MMA. 
      Heated 20% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was slowly injected via the left MMA under 
      bilateral ECA origin flow control. The n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate reached the shunt 
      point and obliterated the shunt in a single session. The patient was discharged 
      without neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral ECA flow control using balloon 
      guide catheter is safe and effective for a DAVF in the superior sagittal sinus with 
      multiple and tortuous scalp feeders.

TI  - Treatment of acute vertebrobasilar occlusion using thrombectomy with stent 
      retrievers: initial experience with 18 patients.
PG  - 1044-8
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A3329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute vertebrobasilar occlusion is an ominous disease with 
      few proved effective treatments. Experience with stent retrievers is scarce and 
      limited to combined therapies (stent retrievers associated with previous intravenous 
      fibrinolysis, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or other mechanical devices). We present 
      our experience with 18 patients treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent 
      retrievers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with vertebrobasilar occlusion 
      were treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent retrievers at our hospital. The 
      mean age was 67.5 years. Clinical presentation was sudden deterioration in 
      consciousness level in 61.2% and progressive or fluctuating brain stem symptoms in 
      38.8%. Stroke subtype (TOAST) was atherothrombotic (33.3%), undetermined (33.3%), 
      cardioembolic (27.7%), and of unusual etiology (5.5%). RESULTS: The occlusion site 
      was the vertebral artery in 1 case, proximal basilar artery in 4, middle basilar 
      artery in 6, distal basilar artery in 5, and unilateral posterior cerebral artery in 
      2 cases. SRs included the Solitaire AB in 8 cases, Solitaire FR in 5 cases, and 
      Trevo Pro in 5 cases. An 8F Merci balloon guide catheter was used in 15 patients, 
      and a Neuron 6F, in 3 patients. Post-clot retrieval definitive intracranial stents 
      were used in 5 patients (27.7%). Postprocedural TICI ≥ 2b was achieved in 17 
      patients (94.4%). Clinically, 72.2% of patients experienced an improved NIHSS score 
      at discharge, 22.2% died, and in 5.5% the NIHSS scores did not change. The mRS score 
      at 3 months was 0-2 in 9 patients (50%) and 3-5 in 5 patients (27.7%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Thrombectomy with stent retrievers is feasible in the treatment of vertebrobasilar 
      occlusion. These initial results must be confirmed by further prospective studies 
      with a larger number of cases.

      Reperfusion.
PG  - 119-131
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1709153 [doi]
AB  - Since 2015, endovascular therapy (EVT) has become the standard of care for acute 
      ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion. It is a safe and highly 
      effective treatment, and its number needed to treat of 2.6 is one of the highest 
      throughout medicine. The ultimate goal when performing EVT is to maximize chances of 
      good outcome through achievement of fast first-pass complete reperfusion, as 
      incomplete and delayed reperfusion increases complication rates and negatively 
      affects outcome. Since EVT has been established as standard of care, new devices 
      have been developed and treatment techniques have been refined. This review provides 
      a brief overview about the rationale for and history of EVT, followed by a detailed 
      step-by-step description of how to perform EVT using the BADDASS (BAlloon guide with 
      large bore Distal access catheter with Dual Aspiration with Stent-retriever as 
      Standard approach), a combined technique, which is in our opinion the safest and 
      most effective way to achieve fast first-pass complete reperfusion. We also discuss 
      treatment strategies for patients with simultaneous high-grade carotid 
      stenosis/pseudoocclusion/occlusion and gaining carotid access in challenging arch 
      anatomy, as these are commonly encountered situations in AIS, and conclude with an 
      outlook on new technologies and future directions of EVT.

      patient, hospital, and health system characteristics on workflow within the trial. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Relationship between outcome (modified Rankin Scale) and 
      interval times was modeled by using logistic regression. Association between time 
      intervals (stroke onset to arrival in endovascular-capable hospital, to qualifying 
      computed tomography, to groin puncture, and to reperfusion) and patient, hospital, 
      and health system characteristics were modeled by using negative binomial 
      regression. Every 30-minute increase in computed tomography-to-reperfusion time 
      reduced the probability of achieving a functionally independent outcome (90-day 
      modified Rankin Scale 0-2) by 8.3% (P=0.006). Symptom onset-to-imaging time was not 
      associated with outcome (P>0.05). Onset-to-endovascular hospital arrival time was 
      42% (34 minutes) longer among patients receiving intravenous alteplase at the 
      referring hospital (drip and ship) versus direct transfer (mothership). Computed 
      tomography-to-groin puncture time was 15% (8 minutes) shorter among patients 
      presenting during work hours versus off hours, 41% (24 minutes) shorter in drip-ship 
      patients versus mothership, and 43% (22 minutes) longer when general anesthesia was 
      administered. The use of a balloon guide catheter during endovascular procedures 
      shortened puncture-to-reperfusion time by 21% (8 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Imaging-to-reperfusion time is a significant predictor of outcome in the ESCAPE 
      trial. Inefficiencies in triaging, off-hour presentation, intravenous alteplase 
      administration, use of general anesthesia, and endovascular techniques offer major 
      opportunities for improvement in workflow. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Development of an in vitro model of calcified cerebral emboli in acute ischemic 
      stroke for mechanical thrombectomy evaluation.
LID - neurintsurg-2019-015595 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015595 [doi]
AB  - ​ BACKGROUND: Calcified cerebral emboli (CCEs) are a rare cause of acute ischemic 
      stroke (AIS) and are frequently associated with poor outcomes. The presence of dense 
      calcified material enables reliable identification of CCEs using non-contrast CT. 
      However, recanalization rates with the available mechanical thrombectomy (MT) 
      devices remain low. OBJECTIVE: To recreate a large vessel occlusion involving a CCE 
      using an in vitro silicone model of the intracranial vessels and to demonstrate the 
      feasability of this model to test different endovascular strategies to recanalize an 
      occlusion of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).​ METHODS: An in 
      vitro model was developed to evaluate different endovascular treatment approaches 
      using contemporary devices in the M1 segment of the MCA. The in vitro model 
      consisted of a CCE analog placed in a silicone neurovascular model. Development of 
      an appropriate CCE analog was based on characterization of human calcified tissues 
      that represent likely sources of CCEs. Feasibility of the model was demonstrated in 
      a small number of MT devices using four common procedural techniques.​ RESULTS: CCE 
      analogs were developed with similar mechanical behavior to that of ex vivo calcified 
      material. The in vitro model was evaluated with various MT techniques and devices to 
      show feasibility of the model. In this limited evaluation, the most successful 
      retrieval approach was performed with a stent retriever combined with local 
      aspiration through a distal access catheter, and importantly, with flow arrest and 
      dual aspiration using a balloon guide catheter.​ CONCLUSION: Characterization of 
      calcified tissues, which are likely sources of CCEs, has shown that CCEs are 
      considerably stiffer than thrombus. This highlights the need for a different in 
      vitro AIS model for CCEs than those used for thromboemboli. Consequentially, an in 
      vitro AIS model representative of a CCE occlusion in the M1 segment of the MCA has 
      been developed.

TI  - First Pass Effect in Patients Treated With the Trevo Stent-Retriever: A TRACK 
      Registry Study Analysis.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2020.00083 [doi]
LID - 83
AB  - Background and Objective: The first pass effect (FPE; achieving complete 
      recanalization with a single thrombectomy device pass) has been shown to be 
      associated with higher rates of good clinical outcomes in patients with acute 
      ischemic stroke. Here, we investigate clinical and radiographic factors associated 
      with FPE in a large U.S. post-marketing registry (TRACK, Trevo Stent-Retriever Acute 
      Stroke). Methods: We analyzed the TRACK database (multicenter registry of 634 
      patients from 23 centers from March 2013 through August 2015), which 609 patients 
      were included in the final analysis. FPE was defined as a single pass/use of device, 
      TICI 2c/3 recanalization, and no use of rescue therapy. Analysis of individual 
      patient data from TRACK were performed to analyze clinical and radiographic 
      characteristics associated with FPE as well-compared clinical outcomes defined as 
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 30 and 90 days from hospital discharge to the 
      non-FPE group. Results: The rate of FPE in TRACK was 23% (140/609). There was no 
      association between patient demographics and FPE, including age (p = 0.36), sex (p = 
      0.50), race (p = 0.50), location of occlusion (p = 0.26), baseline NIHSS (p = 0.62), 
      or past medical history. There was no difference in the use of a balloon-guide 
      catheter or general anesthesia (49 and 57% with FPE vs. 47 and 64%, p = 0.63 and p = 
      0.14, respectively). Clinical outcomes were significantly associated with FPE; 63 
      vs. 44% in non-FPE patients achieved mRS 0-2 at 90 days (p = 0.0004). Conclusion: 
      Our study showed that achieving complete recanalization with a single thrombectomy 
      pass using the Trevo device was highly beneficial. The most common clinical factors 
      that are used to determine eligibility for endovascular therapy, such as NIHSS 
      severity, location of occlusion or patient age were not predictive of the ability to 
      achieve FPE.

TI  - Recanalization of a symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery near occlusion 
      with proximal and distal protection: technical case report.
PG  - E174; discussion E174
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel approach to recanalizing symptomatic extracranial 
      internal carotid artery near occlusion using proximal and distal emboli protection 
      devices. METHODS: Patients presenting with symptomatic extracranial internal carotid 
      artery near occlusion who underwent endovascular recanalization between October 2004 
      and July 2005 were included in this study. During these procedures, a 9-French 
      Concentric Balloon Guide Catheter (Concentric Medical, Mountain View, CA) was 
      advanced into the common carotid artery proximal to the site of occlusion. During 
      the prestent angioplasty of the lesion, the proximal balloon was inflated and 
      aspiration was performed. After initial angioplasty and before stent placement, a 
      distal filter protection device was placed in the distal internal carotid artery. 
      Stent placement and repeat angioplasty were performed with both protection devices 
      active. All patients were placed on dual antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS: There were 
      four patients treated with a mean age of 74 years; three of these four patients were 
      men. All patients had signs of ischemia and carotid occlusion or near occlusion on 
      noninvasive imaging. Three right internal carotid arteries were treated. All 
      patients were successfully recanalized. No procedurally related complications or 
      deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: This series demonstrates the feasibility of 
      recanalization of symptomatic carotid artery occlusion or near occlusion using 
      proximal and distal emboli protection devices. Such an approach may provide an added 
      level of safety during carotid recanalization procedures.

TI  - Tri-axial system using the Solitaire-FR and Penumbra Aspiration Microcatheter for 
      acute mechanical thrombectomy.

LID - S0967-5868(13)00060-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jocn.2012.10.037 [doi]
AB  - The Solitaire-FR (eV3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) retrievable stent (SFR), designed 
      for mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke, recently received Food and 
      Drug Administration approval in the USA. Clot retrieval is performed by deploying 
      the SFR through a microcatheter directly into the thrombus, to capture the clot and 
      restore perfusion. In order to perform this maneuver, a balloon guide catheter must 
      be used to apply negative suction and reverse flow within the cervical arteries, 
      thus minimizing the chance of antegrade blood flow dislodging the thrombus from the 
      stent. This technique requires at least an 8-French system that can increase the 
      risk of arterial injury at the access site particularly in older patients with 
      smaller or highly atherosclerotic peripheral arteries, and may provide inadequate 
      aspiration in the vertebrobasilar system where only one vertebral artery is accessed 
      and aspirated. The author describes a technique whereby a 6-French tri-axial system 
      is used to deliver the SFR through a Penumbra Aspiration Microcatheter (Penumbra, 
      Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) to provide intracranial aspiration in close proximity to the 
      stent.

TI  - Further Development of Combined Techniques Using Stent Retrievers, Aspiration 
      Catheters and BGC : The PROTECT(PLUS) Technique.
PG  - 59-65
LID - 10.1007/s00062-018-0742-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: First pass complete (mTICI 3) reperfusion must be regarded as the ultimate 
      goal in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients suffering from an emergent large 
      vessel occlusion (ELVO). With this in mind a technical modification of the 
      previously published PROTECT (PRoximal balloon Occlusion TogEther with direCt 
      Thrombus aspiration during stent retriever thrombectomy) approach, the PROTECT(PLUS) 
      technique was evaluated. Under proximal flow arrest using a balloon guide catheter 
      (BGC), a stent retriever was only partially inserted into a large-bore aspiration 
      catheter. This construction was subsequently retracted as a unit into the BGC with 
      aspiration both at the aspiration catheter and at the BGC. METHODS: A case-control 
      study was performed comparing the PROTECT technique with the PROTECT(PLUS) technique 
      with respect to the technical and procedural parameters. Patients n = 165 (101 
      PROTECT, 64 PROTECT(PLUS)) with ELVO of either the terminus of the internal carotid 
      artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery were included. RESULTS: Using the 
      PROTECT(PLUS) resulted in a higher rate of first pass complete reperfusions (59.4% 
      vs. 27.7%, p < 0.001) as compared with PROTECT. The PROTECT(PLUS) also led to 
      shorter procedure times (21 min vs. 37 min, p = 0.001) and higher rates of overall 
      complete reperfusion (73.5% vs. 49.5%, p = 0.014) compared to PROTECT. CONCLUSION: 
      The PROTECT(PLUS) technique is a promising technical modification to further 
      optimize endovascular stroke treatment.

TI  - Carotid Stenting as Definitive Treatment for Free Floating Thrombus-Review of 7 
      Cases.
LID - 10.1007/s00062-020-00898-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Free floating thrombus (FFT) is a rare condition. The 
      optimal treatment strategy is yet to be determined although medical management with 
      anticoagulation is the mainstay. This article reports experience of treating FFT 
      with carotid stenting. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively 
      maintained database was performed to identify all patients with FFT treated with 
      carotid stenting. For each patient the demographic data, clinical presentation, 
      location of the thrombus, type of stent and use of adjunctive devices, e.g. balloon 
      guide catheters, clinical and radiological follow-up information as well as 
      complications were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients, 4 female, with mean age 
      of 55.6 ± 14.5 years were identified. The median National Institutes of Health 
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 7 (range 0-13) at presentation. Free floating thrombus was 
      seen on the left in the majority of cases (n = 6, 85.7%). None of the patients had 
      intracranial large vessel occlusion. The FFT was located in the CCA in 2 cases 
      (28.6%) and the proximal ICA in the remaining 5 cases (71.4%). The Wallstent was 
      used in 5 patients and a cGuard stent used in 2 patients. In 1 patient 2 overlapping 
      stents were used but a single stent was used in the remaining patients. In 6 cases 
      a distal filter wire was used and in 2 cases a balloon guide catheter was used as 
      embolic protection. There were no intraoperative complications and no cases of 
      distal clot migration or intracranial large vessel occlusion during the procedure. 
      At last follow-up (n = 7) 6 patients were recorded as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 
      and 1 patient was mRS 3. CONCLUSION: Free floating thrombus of the carotid arteries 
      can be managed with stenting.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of the ANCD thrombectomy device: safety and efficacy in a 
      swine clot model.
LID - neurintsurg-2019-015548 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Advanced Thrombectomy System (ANCD) provides a new funnel component 
      designed to reduce clot fragmentation and facilitate retrieval in patients with 
      stroke by locally restricting flow, allowing distal aspiration in combination with a 
      stent retriever (SR). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preclinical efficacy and safety of 
      the ANCD in a swine clot model. METHODS: Soft and firm clots were implanted in the 
      lingual and cervical arteries of 11 swine to obtain Thrombolysis in Cerebral 
      Infarction (TICI) 0 blood flow. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed with either a 
      balloon guide catheter+Solitaire 2 stent retriever (BGC+SR, n=13) or ANCD+SR (n=13). 
      TICI flow was evaluated and successful revascularization was defined as TICI 3 
      (normal perfusion). To characterize safety, a total of 3 passes were performed in 
      each vessel independent of recanalization. Tissues were explanted for 
      histopathological analysis after 3 and 30 days, respectively. RESULTS: First pass 
      reperfusion rates were ANCD+SR: 69% and BGC+SR: 46%. Reperfusion increased after the 
      third pass in both groups (ANCD+SR: 100%, vs BGC+SR: 77%). Recanalization was 
      achieved after an average of 1.4 and 1.9 passes in ANCD+SR and BGC+SR (p=0.095), 
      respectively. Vessel injury was comparable in both groups; endothelial loss at 3 
      days was the most common injury seen (ANCD+SR: 1.78±1.22; BGC+SR: 2.03±1.20; 
      p=0.73), while other histopathological markers were absent or minimal. Tissues 
      downstream from targeted vessels also showed absence or minimal lesions across both 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results in a swine clot model support the high efficacy of the 
      ANCD+SR without causing clinically significant vessel injury potentially related to 
      the new funnel component.

TI  - Comparison of Aspiration versus Stent Retriever Thrombectomy as the Preferred 
      Strategy for Patients with Acute Terminal Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion: A 
      Propensity Score Matching Analysis.
PG  - 469-476
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A6414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no consensus on endovascular treatment for terminal 
      ICA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy 
      of preferred aspiration thrombectomy and stent retriever thrombectomy for 
      revascularization in patients with isolated terminal ICA occlusion. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with terminal ICA 
      occlusion treated with aspiration thrombectomy or stent retriever thrombectomy in 
      our center, from September 2013 to November 2018. To minimize the case bias, 
      propensity score matching was performed. The primary outcomes were successful 
      reperfusion defined by expanded TICI grades 2b-3 at the end of all endovascular 
      procedures and puncture-to-reperfusion time. RESULTS: A total of 109 consecutive 
      patients with terminal ICA occlusion were divided into the aspiration thrombectomy 
      group (40 patients) and the stent retriever thrombectomy group (69 patients), and 30 
      patients were included in each group after propensity score matching. The proportion 
      of complete reperfusion was significantly higher in the aspiration thrombectomy 
      group (OR 4.75 [95% CI, 1.10-1.38]; P = .002). The median puncture-to-reperfusion 
      time in the aspiration thrombectomy group was shorter than that in the stent 
      retriever thrombectomy group (38  versus 69 minutes; P = .001). Fewer intracerebral 
      hemorrhage events were recorded in the aspiration thrombectomy group (OR 0.29 [95% 
      CI, 0.09-0.90]; P = .028). No significant differences were observed for good 
      outcomes (OR 1.92 [95% CI, 0.86-4.25]) and mortality (OR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.29-2.44]) 
      at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of terminal ICA occlusion, aspiration 
      thrombectomy was technically superior to stent retriever thrombectomy in the absence 
      of a balloon guide catheter in achieving successful reperfusion with shorter 
      puncture-to-reperfusion time and procedure-related adverse events.
