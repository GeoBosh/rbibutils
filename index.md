install.packages("rbibutils")
```

You can also install the [development
version](https://github.com/GeoBosh/rbibutils) of `rbibutils` from
Github:

```

# Overview

Import and export ‘BibTeX’ files. Convert bibliography files between
various formats. All formats supported by the `bibutils` utilities are
available, see
[`bibConvert()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/bibConvert.md)
for a complete list. In addition, conversion from and to `bibentry`, the
R native representation based on Bibtex, is supported.

[`readBib()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBib.md)
and
[`writeBib()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBib.md)
import/export BiBTeX files.
[`readBibentry()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBibentry.md)
and
[`writeBibentry()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBibentry.md)
import/export `R` source files in which the references are represented
by [`bibentry()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/bibentry.html) calls.

The convenience function
[`charToBib()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBib.md)
takes input from a character vector, rather than a file. It calls
[`readBib()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/readBib.md)
or
[`bibConvert()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/bibConvert.md).

[`bibConvert()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/bibConvert.md)
takes an input bibliography file in one of the supported formats,
converts its contents to another format, and writes the result to a
file. All formats, except for `rds` (see below) are plain text files.
[`bibConvert()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/bibConvert.md)
tries to infer the input/output formats from the file extentions. There
is ambiguity however about `bib` files, which can be either Bibtex or
Biblatex. Bibtex is assumed if the format is not specified. Also, the
`xml` extension is shared by XML-based formats. Its default is ‘XML MODS
intermediate’ format.

The default encoding is UTF-8 for both, input and output. All encodings
handled by `bibutils` are supported. Besides UTF-8, these include
`gb18030` (Chinese), ISO encodings such as `iso8859_1`, Windows code
pages (e.g. `cp1251` for Windows Cyrillic) and many others. Common
alternative names are also accepted (e.g. `latin1`).

Bibentry objects can be input from an `R` source file or from an `rds`
file. The `rds` file should contain a `bibentry` R object, saved from R
with [`saveRDS()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html). The `rds`
format is a compressed binary format\`. Alternatively, an R source file
containing one or more bibentry instructions and maybe other commands
can be used. The R file is sourced and all bibentry objects created by
it are collected.

# Examples:

## readBib

The examples in this section import the following file:

``` R
bibacc <- system.file("bib/latin1accents_utf8.bib", package = "rbibutils")
```

Note that some characters may not be displayed on some locales. Also, on
Windows some characters may be “approximated” by other characters.

Import the above bibtex file into a `bibentry` object. By default TeX
escape sequences representing characters are kept as is:

``` R
be0 <- readBib(bibacc)
be0
print(be0, style = "bibtex")
```

As above, using the direct option:

``` R
be1 <- readBib(bibacc, direct = TRUE)
## readBib(bibacc, direct = TRUE, texChars = "keep") # same
be1
print(be1, style = "bibtex")
```

Use the `"convert"` option to convert TeX sequences to true characters:

``` R
be2 <- readBib(bibacc, direct = TRUE, texChars = "convert")
be2
print(be2, style = "R")
```

(On Windows the Greek characters alpha and delta may be printed as ‘a’
and ‘d’ but internally they are alpha and delta.)

Use the `"export"` option to convert other characters to ASCII TeX
sequences, when possible (currently this option doesn’t handle well
mathematical expressions):

``` R
be3 <- readBib(bibacc, direct = TRUE, texChars = "export")
print(be3, style = "bibtex")
```

## bibConvert

Convert Bibtex file `myfile.bib` to a `bibentry` object and save the
latter to \`“myfile.rds”:

``` R
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "myfile.rds", informat = "bibtex", outformat = "bibentry")
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "myfile.rds")
```

Convert Bibtex file `myfile.bib` to a Biblatex save to \`“biblatex.bib”:

``` R
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "biblatex.bib", "bibtex", "biblatex")
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "biblatex.bib", outfile = "biblatex")
```

Convert Bibtex file `myfile.bib` to Bibentry and save as `rds` or `R`:

``` R
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "myfile.rds")
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "myfile.R")
```

Read back the above files and/or convert them to other formats:

``` R
readLines("myfile.R")
file.show("myfile.R")
readRDS("myfile.rds")
bibConvert("myfile.rds", "myfile.bib")
bibConvert("myfile.R", "myfile.bib")
```

Assuming `myfile.bib` is a Biblatex file, convert it to Bibtex and save
to `bibtex.bib`:

``` R
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "bibtex.bib", "biblatex", "bibtex")
bibConvert("myfile.bib", "bibtex.bib", "biblatex")
```

Assuming “myfile.med” is a PubMed file, convert it to Bibtex:

``` R
bibConvert(infile = "myfile.med", outfile = "bibtex.bib", informat = "med", outformat = "bib")
bibConvert(infile = "myfile.med", outfile = "bibtex.bib", informat = "med") # same
```

See
[`bibConvert()`](https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/reference/bibConvert.md)
for further examples and their results.
